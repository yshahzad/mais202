{"title":"Temporal relationship between outbound traffic from Wuhan and the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) incidence in China","doi":"10.1101\/2020.03.15.20034199","authors":"Shi, Z.; Fang, Y.","abstract":"BackgroundThe city of Wuhan is the epicenter of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak and a central Chinese hub for transportation and industry. Mass migration prior to the Chinese New Year may have accelerated the spread of COVID-19 across China. This analysis investigated the temporal relationship between daily outbound traffic from Wuhan and the incidence of COVID-19 in 31 Chinese provinces during January-February 2020.\n\nMethodsWe collected incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases from National and Provincial Health Committee reports from January 10 to February 29, 2020. Volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan to other provinces was measured by Baidu Migration Index, a widely used metric that tracks migration based on cellphone location. We used cross-correlation function and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to examine time-lagged association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence by province. Contributors to the provincial variation in the temporal associations were investigated. Additionally, we estimated the reduction in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases following the travel ban for Wuhan.\n\nResultsCross-correlation function analyses suggested that the volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan was positively associated with COVID-19 incidence in all provinces, with correlation coefficients between 0.22-0.78 (all P<0.05). Approximately 42% of provinces showed <1 week of lag between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence, 39% with 1 week, and 19% with 2-3 weeks. Migration had more prolonged impacts in provinces closer to Wuhan and with more passenger influx from Wuhan, but affected economically advantaged provinces to a lesser extent. We further estimated that the travel ban may have prevented approximately 19,768 COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 13,589, 25,946) outside of Wuhan by February 29, 2020.\n\nConclusionsOutflowing migration from Wuhan facilitated the COVID-19 transmission to other parts of China with varying time-lagged effects dependent on provincial characteristics. The travel ban led to a significant reduction in COVID-19 outside of Wuhan.","date":"2020-03-17","journal":""}

The current study describes the situation of the outbreak of this disease in India and predicts the number of cases expected to rise in India. The study also discusses the regional analysis of Indian states and presents the preparedness level of India in combating this outbreak. The study uses exploratory data analysis to report the current situation and uses time-series forecasting methods to predict the future trends. The data has been considered from the repository of John Hopkins University and covers up the time period from 30th January 2020 when the first case occurred in India till the end of 24th March 2020 when the Prime Minister of India declared a complete lockdown in the country for 21 days starting 25th March 2020. The major findings show that number of infected cases in India is rising quickly with the average infected cases per day rising from 10 to 73 from the first case to the 300th case. The current mortality rate for India stands around 1.9. Kerala and Maharashtra are the top two infected states in India with more than 100 infected cases reported in each state, respectively. A total of 25 states have reported at least one infected case, however only 8 of them have reported deaths due to COVID-19. The ARIMA model prediction shows that the infected cases in India may reach up to 700 thousands in next 30 days in worst case scenario while most optimistic scenario may restrict the numbers up to 1000-1200. Also, the average forecast by ARIMA model in next 30 days is around 7000 patients from the current numbers of 536. Based on the forecasting model by Holts linear trends, an expected 3 million people may get infected if control measures are not taken in the near future. This study will be useful for the key stakeholders like Government Officials and Medical Practitioners in assessing the trends for India and preparing a combat plan with stringent measures. Also, this study will be helpful for data scientists, statisticians, mathematicians and analytics professionals in predicting outbreak numbers with better accuracy.","date":"2020-03-30","journal":""}

We aimed to determine whether influenza diagnoses masked early COVID-19 cases and, if so, estimate numbers of undetected COVID-19 cases in a large database of primary-care records covering >6 million people in Catalonia.\n\nDesignTime-series study of influenza and COVID-19 cases, using all influenza seasons from autumn-winter 2010-2011 to autumn-winter 2019-2020.\n\nSettingPrimary care, Catalonia, Spain.\n\nParticipantsPeople registered in one of the contributing primary-care practices, covering >6 million people and >85% of the population.\n\nMain outcome measuresWeekly new cases of influenza and COVID-19 diagnosed in primary care.\n\nAnalysesDaily counts of both cases were computed using the total cases recorded over the previous 7 days to avoid weekly effects on recording practice. Epidemic curves were characterised for the 2010-2011 to 2019-2020 influenza seasons. Influenza seasons with a similar epidemic curve and peak case number as the 2019-2020 season were used to model predictions for 2019-2020. ARIMA models were fitted to the included influenza seasons, overall and stratified by age, to estimate expected case numbers. Daily excess influenza cases were defined as the number of observed minus expected cases.\n\nResultsFour influenza season curves (2011-2012, 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and 2016-2017) were used to estimate the number of expected cases of influenza in 2019-2020. Between 4 February 2020 and 20 March 20202, 8,017 (95% CI: 1,841 to 14,718) excess influenza cases were identified. This excess was highest in the 15-64 age group.\n\nConclusionsCOVID-19 cases may have been present in the Catalan population when the first imported case was reported on 25 February 2020. COVID-19 carriers may have been misclassified as influenza diagnoses in primary care, boosting community transmission before public health measures were taken. In future, the surveillance of excess influenza cases using widely available primary-care electronic medical records could help detect new outbreaks of COVID-19 or other influenza-like illness-causing pathogens. Earlier detection would allow public health responses to be initiated earlier than during the current crisis.","date":"2020-04-14","journal":""}

J.; Alem, A.; Chibanda, D.; Fairall, L.; Fekadu, A.; Hanlon, C.; Lund, C.; Leather, A. J.; Petersen, I.; Verhey, R.; Wurie, H.","abstract":"BackgroundThe COVID-19 outbreak in sub-Saharan African countries started after those in Asia, Europe and North America, on 28th February 2020. The susceptibility to infection of populations in that region has been debated. Outbreaks on the scale of those seen elsewhere would pose substantial challenges. There are reasons for concern that transmission may be high and difficult to control, rapidly exceeding capacity to meet the needs for hospitalization and critical care.\n\nMethodsWe obtained data on daily new confirmed cases for all 46 countries from the World Health Organization, and used these to model and visualize growth trajectories using an AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. We then estimated doubling times from growth rates estimated from Poisson regression models, and by back counting from the most recent observation. We also calculated the time from 1st to 50th case, and the time from 5th to 100th case. These indicators were compared with the same summary indicators of growth at the same stage of the outbreak in highly affected European countries.\n\nResultsKenya was the only country with clear evidence of exponential growth. Nineteen countries had either reported no cases, were in the first few days of the outbreak, or had reported fewer than 10 cases over a period of two or more weeks. For the remaining 27 countries we identified four growth patterns: slow linear growth, more rapid linear growth, variable growth patterns over the course of the outbreak, and early signs of possible exponential growth. For those in the last three groups, doubling times ranged from 3 to 4 days, times from 1st to 50th case from 12 to 29 days, and from 5th to 100th case from eight to 15 days. These early indicators are comparable to those in European countries that have gone on to have substantial outbreaks, and time to 50th case was shorter suggesting lesser effectiveness of contact-tracing and quarantine in the early phase.\n\nConclusionThe 46 sub-Saharan African countries, home to over one billion people, are at a tipping point with clear potential for the outbreak to follow a similar course as in HIC in the global north. Radical population-level physical distancing measures may be required, but their impact on poor, disadvantaged and vulnerable people and communities need mitigating.

H.","abstract":"ObjectiveThis study is focused on the analysis of the spread of Covid-19 in Nigeria, applying statistical models and available data from the NCDC. We present an insight into the spread of Covid-19 in Nigeria in order to establish a suitable prediction model, which can be applied as a decision-supportive tool for assigning health interventions and mitigating the spread of the Covid-19 infection.\n\nMethodologyDaily spread data from February 27 to April 26, 2020, were collected to construct the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model using the R software. Stability analysis and stationarity test, parameter test, and model diagnostic were also carried out. Finally, the fitting, selection and prediction accuracy of the ARIMA model was evaluated using the AICc model selection criteria.\n\nResultsThe ARIMA (1,1,0) model was finally selected among ARIMA models based upon the parameter test and Box-Ljung test. A ten-day forecast was also made from the model, which shows a steep upward trend of the spread of the COVID-19 in Nigeria within the selected time frame.\n\nConclusionFederal Government of Nigeria through the presidential task force can apply the forecasted trend of much more spread to make more informed decisions on the additional measures in place to curb the spread of the virus. Application of the model can also assist in studying the effectiveness of the lockdown on the on the spread of Covid-19 in Nigeria.","date":"2020-05-08","journal":""}

Prediction about the number of infected and death cases may help to take immediate action to prevent the epidemic as well as control the situation of a country. The ongoing debate about the climate factors may need more validation with more studies. The climate factors of the top-five affected countries and three south Asian countries have considered in this study to have a real-time forecast and robust validation about the impact of climate variables.\n\nMethodsThe ARIMA model have included to model the univariate cumulative confirmed and death cases separately. The MLP, ELM and likelihood-based GLM count time series also considered as they consider the external variables as exogenous regressors. As the death count includes zero itself, zero-inflated count time series model has included instead of likelihood-based GLM. The better fitting of the ARIMA model will validate the under-whelm of meteorological factors was the initial hypothesis. The best model has identified through the application and comparison with the real data points.\n\nResultsThe results depict that there is an influence of meteorological variables like temperature and humidity mostly for all the selected countries cumulative confirm cases excluding Italy and Sri-Lanka.

To understand the overall impact on mortality of the pandemic of COVID-19, we estimated the excess mortality registered in Portugal during the first month of the epidemic, from March 16 until April 14 using two different methods.\n\nMethodsWe compared the observed and expected daily deaths (historical average number from daily death registrations in the past 10 years) and used 2 standard deviations confidence limit for all-cause mortality by age and specific mortality cause, considering the last 6 years. An adapted ARIMA model was also tested to validate the estimated number of all-cause deaths during the study period.\n\nResultsBetween March 16 and April 14, there was an excess of 1,255 all-cause deaths, 14% more than expected. The number of daily deaths often surpassed the 2 standard deviations confidence limit. The excess mortality occurred mostly in people aged 75+. Forty-nine percent (49%) of the estimated excess deaths were registered as due to COVID-19, The other 51% registered as other natural causes.\n\nConclusionEven though Portugal took early containment measures against COVID-19, and the population complied massively with those measures, there was significant excess mortality during the first month of the pandemic, mostly among people aged 75+.

This pandemic has critical health and economic consequences, and even the health services of the large, powerful nations may be saturated. Thus, forecasting the number of infected persons in any country is essential for controlling the situation. In the literature, different forecasting methods have been published, attempting to solve the problem. However, a simple and accurate forecasting method is required for its implementation in any part of the world. This paper presents a precise and straightforward forecasting method named SVR-ESAR (Support Vector regression hybridized with the classical Exponential smoothing and ARIMA). We applied this method to the infected time series in four scenarios, which we have taken for the Github repository: the Whole World, China, the US, and Mexico.

A Healthcare Compartmental Epidemic Model (HeCEM), which accounts for Hospital and Intensive Care Unit admission rates, was developed to also simulate the effect of reversing social distancing containment measures. Reported COVID-19 cases between February 29th and April 23rd, 2020 were obtained from the Servicio Nacional de Gestion de Riesgos y Emergencia, Ecuadors national emergency management office. An ARIMA model was used to forecast reported number of cases based on the reported number of cases.

Partial or full reversal of containment measures before reaching the point where hospital and ICU beds are enough to meet the expected demand will result in secondary waves that delay reaching this equilibrium, resulting in thousands of excess deaths.

The Portuguese people complied quickly, reducing their overall mobility by 80%. We estimate the impact of the lockdown in Portugal in terms of reducing burden on the health service.\n\nMethodsWe forecasted epidemic curves for: Cases, hospital inpatients (overall and in ICU), and deaths without lockdown, assuming that the impact of containment measures would start 14 days after lockdown was implemented. We used exponential smoothing models for deaths, intensive care (ICU) and hospitalizations and an ARIMA model for number of cases. Models were selected considering fitness to the observed data to the 31st of March 2020. We then compared observed(with intervention) and forecasted curves (without intervention).\n\nResultsBetween April 1 and April 15, there were 146 fewer deaths(-25%), 5568 fewer cases (-23%) and, as of April 15, there were 519 fewer ICU inpatients(-69%) and 508 fewer overall hospital inpatients(-28%) than forecasted without lockdown. On April 15 the number of ICU inpatients could have reached 748, three times higher than the observed value (229) if the intervention had been delayed.\n\nConclusionIf the lockdown had not been implemented in mid-March, Portugal ICU capacity (528 ICU beds) would likely have been breached in the first half of April. The lockdown seems to have been effective in reducing transmission of SARS-Cov-2, serious Covid-19 illness and associated mortality, thereby decreasing demand on health services. Early action allowed time for the National Health Service to acquire protective equipment, to increase capacity to test and cope with the surge in hospital and ICU demand caused by the pandemic.","date":"2020-05-27","journal":""}

We analyzed the trend, modelling and impact assessment of COVID-19 disease, cases of Nepal from 23rd January 2020 to 30th April 2020 to portray the scenario of COVID-19 after the first phase of lockdown. Exponential smoothing state-space and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were constructed to forecast the cases. Susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model was fit to estimate the basic reproduction number (Ro) of COVID-19 in Nepal. There has been increase in the number of cases but the overall growth in COVID-19 was not high. Statistical modelling has shown that COVID-19 cases may continue to increase exponentially in Nepal. The basic reproduction number in Nepal being maintained at low level of 1.08 for the period of 23rd January to 30th April 2020 is an indication of effectiveness of lockdown in containing the COVID-19 spread. The models further suggest that COVID-19 might persist until December 2020 with peak cases in August 2020. On the other hand, basic reproduction number of 1.25 was computed for total cases reported for the 22nd March to 30th April 2020 period implying that COVID-19 may remain for at least for a year in the country.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) causes fever, cough, sore throat, and in severe cases shortness of breath and death. To evaluate strategies, it is necessary to forecast the number of cases and deaths, in order to aid the stakeholders in the process of making decisions against the disease. We propose a system for real-time forecast of the cumulative cases of Covid-19 in Brazil.\n\nStudy DesignMonitoring of all Brazilian cities using oficial information from the National Notification System, from March to May 2020, concentrated on Brazil.io databases. Training and evaluation of ARIMA and other machine learning algorithms for temporal forecasting using correlation indexes (Pearsons, Spearmans, and Kendalls) and RMSE(%). Validation from the relative errors of the following six days.\n\nMethodsOur developed software, COVID-SGIS, captures information from the 26 states and the Distrito Federal at the Brazil.io database. From these data, ARIMA models are created for the accumulation of confirmed cases and death cases by Covid-19. Finally, six-day forecasts graphs are available for Brazil and for each of its federative units, separately, with a 95% CI.

Meanwhile Maharashtra, Punjab, Gujarat and Delhi (UT) will be the most affected states, having the highest number of active and confirmed cases at the end of August.\n\nDiscussion and ConclusionThis forecasts show a very crucial situation for West Bengal in coming days and, the actual numbers can go higher than our estimates of confirmed case as Lockdown 5.0 & Unlock 1.0 will be implemented from 1st June 2020 in India, West Bengal will be observing a partial lift of the lockdown and in that case, there will be a surge in the number of daily confirmed and active cases. The requirement of Health care sector needs to be further improved isolation beds, ICUs and ventilators will also be needed to increase in that scenario. Inter State & Intra State Movement restrictions are lifted. Hence, Migrants returning to their homes due to loss of livelihood and income in the lockdown period may lead to a rise in the number of cases, which could not be accounted for in our projections. We suggest more of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model in the health sector to accommodate COVID-19 patients adequately and reduce the burden of the already overstretched Indian public health care system, which will directly or indirectly affect the States in the time of crisis.","date":"2020-06-08","journal":""}

In this research, we studied the trend, model Nigeria daily COVID-19 cases and forecast for the future occurrences in the country at large. We adopt the Box and Jenkins approach. The time plot showed that the cases of COVID-19 rises rapidly in recent time. KPSS test confirms the non-stationarity of the process (p < 0.05) before differencing. The test also confirmed the stationarity of the process (p > 0.05) after differencing. Various ARIMA (p,d,q) were examined with their respective AICs and Log-likelihood. ARIMA (1, 2, 1) was selected as the best model due to its least AIC (559.74) and highest log likelihood (-276.87). Both Shapiro-Wilk test and Box test performed confirm the fitness of the model (p > 0.05) for the series. Forecast for 30 days was then made for COVID-19 cases in Nigeria. Conclusively, the model obtained in this research can be used to model, monitor and forecast the daily occurrence of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria.","date":"2020-06-16","journal":""}

The W-LSTM model developed in this study, performs better in terms of MSE, R2 and MAPE, as compared to the previously published models, including ARIMA, LSTM and their variations. Using W-LSTM model, we have predicted the beginning and end of the current cycle of COVID-19 in several countries. Performance of the model was validated as satisfactory in 82% of the 50 test countries, while asking for prediction for 10 days beyond the period of training. Accuracy of the above prediction with days beyond training was assessed in comparison with the MAPE that the model gave with cumulative global data. The model was applied to study correlation between the growth of infection and deaths, and a number of effectors that may influence the epidemic. The model identified age groups, trade with China, air traffic, country temperature and CoV-2 virus types as the likely effectors of infection and virulence leading to deaths. The predictors likely to promote or suppress the epidemic were identified. Some of the predictors had significant effect on the shape parameters of Weibull distribution. The model can function on cloud, take inputs in real time and handle large data country wise, at low costs to make predictions dynamically. Such predictions are highly valuable in guiding policy makers, administration and health.

Understanding the trend of COVID-19 is crucial to establishing the appropriate precautionary measures to mitigate the epidemic spread. The aim of this paper was to modifying and enhancing the mathematical modeling to guide health authority and assist in an early assessment of the epidemic outbreak and can be utilised to monitor non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Both ARIMA model and Logistic growth model were developed to study the trend and to provide short and long-term forecasting of the prevalence of COVID-19 cases and dynamics. The data analyzed in this study covered the period between 2nd March and 21st June 2020. Two different scenarios were developed to predict the epidemic fluctuating trends and dynamics. The first scenario covered the period between 2nd March and 28th May when the first peak was observed and immediately declined. The analysis projected that the COVID-19 epidemic to reach a peak by 17th May with a total number of 58,534 infected cases and to end on the 4th August, if lockdown were not interrupted and folks followed the recommended personal and social safety guidelines. The second scenario was simulated because of the sudden sharp spike witnessed in the trend of the new confirmed cases on the last week of May and continue to escalate till the time of current writing-21st June. In the 2nd scenario, the analysis estimated the epidemic to peak on 15th June with a total number of 146,004 infected cases and to end on 29th September, 2020 with a final size of 209,607 (185,757 to 244,310) infected cases, assuming that the NPIs will be maintained while new normal life is resumed carefully. ARIMA and Logistic growth models showed excellent performance in projecting the epidemic prevalence, trends and dynamics at different phases. In conclusion, the analysis presented in this paper will assist policy-makers and health care authorities to evaluate the effect of the NPIs applied and to size the resources needed to manage different phases and cope with the final size of the epidemic estimates and to impose extra precautions.","date":"2020-06-26","journal":""}

Therefore, many national public health organizations make local Dengue incidence data publicly available for individuals and organizations to use to manage current risk. The availability of these data has also resulted in active research into the forecasting of Dengue incidence as a way to increase the public health value of incidence data. Here, we robustly assess time-series-based forecasting approaches against a null model (historical average incidence) for the forecasting of incidence up to four months ahead. We used publicly available data from multiple countries: Brazil, Mexico, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Thailand; and found that our time series methods are more accurate than the null model across all populations, especially for 1-and 2-month ahead forecasts. We tested whether the inclusion of climatic data improved forecast accuracy and found only modest, if any improvements. We also tested whether national timeseries forecasts are more accurate if made from aggregate sub-national forecasts, and found mixed results. We used our forecasting results to illustrate the high value of increased reporting speed. This framework and test data are available as an R package. The non-mechanistic approaches described here motivates further research into the use of disease-dynamic models to increase the accuracy of medium-term Dengue forecasting across multiple populations.\n\nAuthor summaryDengue is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the Dengue virus. Since the Second World War it has evolved into a global problem, securing a foothold in more than 100 countries. Each year, hundreds of millions of people become infected, and upwards of 10,000 die from the disease. Thus, being able to accurately forecast the number of cases likely to emerge in particular locations is vital for public health professionals to be able to develop appropriate plans. In this study, we have refined a technique that allows us to forecast the number of cases of Dengue in a particular location, up to four months in advance. We test the approach using state-level and national-level data from Brazil, Mexico, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. We found that the model can generally make useful forecasts, particularly on a two-month horizon. We tested whether information about climatic conditions improved the forecast, and found only modest improvements to the forecast. Our results highlight the need for both timely and accurate reports. We also anticipate that this approach may be more generally useful to the scientific community; thus, we are releasing a framework, which will allow interested parties to replicate our work, as well as apply it to other sources of Dengue data, as well as other infectious diseases in general.","date":"2020-06-29","journal":""}

This study aims to provide such guidance by forecasting the cumulative COVID-19 cases up to 4 weeks ahead for 173 countries, using four data-driven methodologies; autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), exponential smoothing model (ETS), random walk forecasts (RWF) with and without drift. We also evaluate the accuracy of these forecasts using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The results show that the ARIMA and ETS methods outperform the other two forecasting methods. Additionally, using these forecasts, we generated heat maps to provide a pictorial representation of the countries at risk of having an increase in cases in the coming 4 weeks for June. Due to limited data availability during the ongoing pandemic, less data-hungry forecasting models like ARIMA and ETS can help in anticipating the future burden of SARS-CoV2 on healthcare systems.","date":"2020-08-04","journal":""}

This study aimed to perform a time series analysis on the association between climate factors and daily cases of COVID-19 in Malaysia up to 15 July 2020. The second objective was to predict daily new cases using a forecasting technique. To address within-country variations, the analysis was extended to the state level with Sarawak state as an example.\n\nMethodology\/Principal FindingsDatasets on the daily confirmed cases and climate variables in Malaysia and Sarawak state were obtained from publicly accessible official websites. A descriptive analysis was performed to characterize all the important variables over the study period. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was introduced using daily cases as the dependent variable and climate parameters as the explanatory variables.\n\nFor Malaysia, the findings suggest that, ceteris paribus, the number of COVID-19 cases decreased with increasing average temperature (p=0.003) or wind speed (p=0.029). However, none of the climate parameters showed a significant relationship with the number of COVID-19 cases in Sarawak state.

India is currently among the worst-hit nations worldwide, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and ranks just behind Brazil and USA. In order to prevent the further worsening of the situation, predicting the future course of the pandemic is of utmost importance. In this paper, we model the past trajectory (March 01, 2020 - July 25, 2020) and make a month-long (July 26, 2020 - August 24, 2020) forecast of the future evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in India using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model.

The implications of these forecasts are that in the upcoming month the infection rate of COVID-19 in India is going to escalate, while as the rate of recovery and the case-fatality rate is likely to reduce. In order to avert these possible scenarios, the administration and health-care personnel need to formulate and implement robust control measures, while the general public needs to be more responsible and strictly adhere to the established and newly formulated guidelines to slow down the spread of the pandemic and prevent it from transforming into a catastrophe.","date":"2020-09-11","journal":""}

The peak of COVID-19 cases is the most warranted feature for understanding the curvature of COVID-19 cases.\n\nAimThis study aims to analyse the growth rates of the daily confirmed cases and to provide an expected count of the peak of daily confirmed cases.\n\nDataWe retrieved data from an Application Programming Interface portal https:\/\/www.covid19india.org\/ which is open access and publicly available.\n\nMethodsExponential model was applied to estimate the growth rates of daily confirmed cases. The estimated growth rates were used for calculating the doubling time. The Lotka-Euler method was applied to calculate the effective reproduction rate. SARIMA model was developed for the growth rates to predict daily confirmed cases.\n\nResultsResults show the best fit of the exponential model over the daily confirmed cases. The growth rates estimated from the exponential model shows an unsteady, modest decline. Doubling time shows a linear increase. The effective reproduction rate declined from 3.6 persons in the third week of March 2020 to 1.14 persons at the end of August 2020 and 1.12 persons in the mid-September 2020. The diagnosis of the developed SARIMA model confirmed no trends in the residuals, no outliers, and nearly constant variance. The forecast suggests the peak value of daily confirmed cases would waver around 105,000 counts in the third week of September 2020.

The peak of COVID-19 cases is the most warranted feature for understanding the curvature of COVID-19 cases.\n\nAimThis study aims to analyse the growth rates of the daily confirmed cases and to provide an expected count of the peak of daily confirmed cases.\n\nDataWe retrieved data from an Application Programming Interface portal https:\/\/www.covid19india.org\/ which is open access and publicly available.\n\nMethodsExponential model was applied to estimate the growth rates of daily confirmed cases. The estimated growth rates were used for calculating the doubling time. The Lotka-Euler method was applied to calculate the effective reproduction rate. SARIMA model was developed for the growth rates to predict daily confirmed cases.\n\nResultsResults show the best fit of the exponential model over the daily confirmed cases. The growth rates estimated from the exponential model shows an unsteady, modest decline. Doubling time shows a linear increase. The effective reproduction rate declined from 3.6 persons in the third week of March 2020 to 1.14 persons at the end of August 2020 and 1.12 persons in the mid-September 2020. The diagnosis of the developed SARIMA model confirmed no trends in the residuals, no outliers, and nearly constant variance. The forecast suggests the peak value of daily confirmed cases would waver around 105,000 counts in the third week of September 2020.

Then, this study aimed to model and forecast of COVID-19 new cases in these top 10 infected African countries.\n\nMethodsIn this study, the COVID 19 new cases data have been modeled and forecasted using curve estimation regression and time series models for these top 10 infected African countries from Feb 14 to Sep 6, 2020.\n\nResultsFrom July to August, the prevalence of COVID-19 cumulative cases was declined in South Africa, Cote d{square}Ivoire, Egypt, Ghana, Cameron, Nigeria, and Algeria by 31%, 26%, 22%, 20%, 14%, 12%, and 4%, respectively. But, it was highly raised in Ethiopia and Morocco by 41%, and 38% in this period, respectively. In Kenya, it was raised only by 1%. In this study, the cubic regression models for the ln(COVID-19 new cases) data were relatively the best fit for Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria and South Africa. And, the quadratic regression models for the data were the best fit for Cameroon, Cote d{square}Ivoire and Ghana. The Algeria data was followed the logarithmic regression model. In the time series analysis, the Algeria, Egypt, and South Africa COVID-19 new cases data have fitted the ARIMA (0,1,0), ARIMA (0,1,0), and ARIMA (0,1,14) models, respectively. The Cameroon, Cote dIvoire, Ghana, and Nigeria data have fitted the simple exponential smoothing models. The Ethiopia, Kenya, and Morocco data have followed the Damped trend, Holt, and Brown exponential smoothing models, respectively. In the analysis, the trends of COVID-19 new cases will be declined for Algeria and Ethiopia, and the trends will be constantan for Cameroon, Cote dIvoire, Ghana and Nigeria. But, it will be raised slightly for Egypt and Kenya, and significantly for Morocco and South Africa from September 7 to October 6, 2020.\n\nConclusionThis study was conducted with the current measures; the forecasts and trends nobtained may differ from the number of cases that occur in the future. Thus, the study finding should be useful in preparedness planning against further spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in African countries. And, the researcher recommended that as many countries continue to relax restrictions on movement and mass gatherings, and more are opening their airspaces, and the countries other public and private sectors are reopening. So, strong appropriate public health and social measures must be instituted on the grounds again.","date":"2020-09-24","journal":""}

S.","abstract":"The coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic is defining a global health crisis, which is the hugest challenge the world has faced since World War II. Accordingly, the global economy as well is facing the worst economic catastrophe since the 1930s Great Depression. The case in Egypt is similar to the rest of the world. Despite being threatened by GDP decline and income losses; the Egyptian government has reacted early to restrain the pandemic outbreak. By mid-March, many measures had been undertaken to contain the spread of the virus. More than three months after imposing them, Egypt began lifting many of the restrictions put in place to curb the spread of coronavirus. Predictions of the potential spread of Covid-19 based on time series Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and econometric Autoregressive-Distributed Lag (ARDL) forecasting models are utilized in this paper for designing and\/or evaluating countermeasures. The aim of this study is threefold, first using the most recent available data to find the best prediction models for daily cases and death in Egypt and forecast them up to 7 November 2020. Second, to analyze the effect of mobility on the incidence of the pandemic using Google Community Mobility Reports (GCMR) to evaluate the results of easing lockdown restrictions. Finally, providing some recommendations that may help lessen the spread of the virus and eradicate new deaths as possible. The results revealed that mobility of population is affecting the incidence of new cases of Covid-19 significantly over the period of the study. Additionally, the total number of infections on November 7 2020 is expected to reach 102,352 cases, while the total death toll is predicted to be 5,938 according to the most accurate methods of forecasting. Accordingly, in order to sustain the predicted flat pandemic curve, many restrictions must be continued and emergency mechanisms need to be considered. For instance, adhering to the precautions of social distancing advised by the health minister and the declared hygiene rules to ensure that infection is prevented or transmitted is necessary. Besides, being prepared with re-imposing lockdown strategies and health system support are essential among others. It should also be noted that this expected pattern can shift, yet that depends on peoples actions.","date":"2020-09-30","journal":""}

While increases in psychiatric stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic are anticipated, whether suicide rates changed during stay-at-home periods has not been described.\n\nThis was an observational cohort study that assembled suicide death data for persons aged 10 years or older from the Massachusetts Department of Health Registry of Vital Records and Statistics from January 2015 through May 2020. Using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and seasonal ARIMA to analyze suicide deaths in Massachusetts, we compared the observed number of suicide deaths in Massachusetts during the stay-at-home period (March through May, 2020) in Massachusetts to the projected number of expected deaths. To be conservative, we also accounted for the deaths still pending final cause determination\n\nThe incident rate for suicide deaths in Massachusetts was 0.67 per 100,000 person-month (95% CI 0.56-0.79) versus 0.81 per 100,000 person-month (95% CI 0.69-0.94) during the 2019 corresponding period (incident rate ratio of 0.83; 95% CI 0.66-1.03). The addition of the 57 deaths pending cause determination occurring from March through May 2020 and the 33 cases still pending determination from the 2019 corresponding period did not change these findings.\n\nThe observed number of suicide deaths during the stay-at-home period did not deviate from ARIMA projected expectations using either preliminary data or an alternate scenario in which deaths pending investigation (exceeding the average remaining number of deaths still pending investigation which occurred during the corresponding 2015-2019 period) were ascribed to suicide. Decedent age and sex demographics were unchanged during the pandemic period compared to 2015-2019.\n\nThe stable rates of suicide deaths during the stay-at-home advisory in Massachusetts parallel findings following ecological disasters. As the pandemic persists, uncertainty about its scope and economic impact may increase. However, our data are reassuring that an increase in suicide deaths in Massachusetts during the stay-at-home advisory period did not occur.","date":"2020-10-20","journal":""}

In this paper, we compare different time series methodologies to predict the number of confirmed cases and deaths from Covid-19 in Chile and thus support the decisions of health agencies;\n\n(2) MethodsWe modeled the confirmed cases and deaths from Covid-19 in Chile by using ARIMA models, exponential smoothing techniques, Poisson models for time-dependent counting data. In addition, we evaluated the accuracy of the predictions by using a training set and test set;\n\n(3) ResultsThe database used in this paper allows us to say that for the confirmed Covid-19 cases the best model corresponds to a well-known Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time-series model, whereas for deaths from Covid-19 in Chile the best model resulted in damped trend method;\n\n(4) ConclusionARIMA models are an alternative to model the behavior of the spread of Covid19, however, and depending on the characteristics of the data set, other methodologies can better capture the behavior of these records, for example, Holt-winters method and time-dependent counting models.","date":"2021-01-05","journal":""}

As of 28 November 2020, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with a total of more than 6,171,5119 confirmed infections and more than 1,44,4235 confirmed deaths reported worldwide. The main focus of this paper is to generate LTM real-time out of sample forecasts of the future COVID-19 confirmed and death cases respectively for the top ten profoundly affected countries including for the world. To solve this problem we introduced a novel hybrid approach AARNN model based on ARIMA and ARNN forecasting model that can generate LTM (fifty days ahead) out of sample forecasts of the number of daily confirmed and death COVID-19 cases for the ten countries namely USA, India, Brazil, Russia, France, Spain, UK, Italy, Argentina, Colombia and also for the world respectively. The predictions of the future outbreak for different countries will be useful for the effective allocation of health care resources and will act as early-warning system for health warriors, corporate leaders, economists, government\/public-policy makers, and scientific experts.","date":"2021-01-05","journal":""}

Diverticular bleeding cases had higher rates of hemodynamic instability, rebleeding, endoscopic therapy, IVR, and transfusion, but lower rates of death and surgery than other etiologies. Small bowel bleeding cases had significantly higher rates of surgery, IVR, and transfusion than other etiologies. Malignancy or upper GIB cases had significantly higher rates of thromboembolism and death than other etiologies. Etiologies that have favorable outcomes were ischemic colitis, infectious colitis, and post-endoscopy bleeding.\n\nConclusionsLarge-scale data of patients with acute hematochezia revealed high proportions of colonoscopy and CT, resulting in high endoscopic therapy rates.

The contribution of external causes of death to excess mortality including drug overdose, homicide, suicide, and unintentional injuries during the initial outbreak in the United States is less well documented.\n\nMethodsUsing public data published by the National Center for Health Statistics on February 10, 2021, we measured monthly excess mortality (the gap between observed and expected deaths) from five external causes using national-level data published by National Center for Health Statistics; assault (homicide); intentional self-harm (suicide); accidents (unintentional injuries); and motor vehicle accidents. We used seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (sARIMA) models developed with cause-specific monthly mortality counts and US population data from 2015-2019 and estimated the contribution of individual cause-specific mortality to all-cause excess mortality from March-July 2020.\n\nResultsFrom March-July, 2020, 212,825 (95% CI 136,236-290,776) all-cause excess deaths occurred in the US). There were 8,540 excess drug overdoses (all intents) (95% CI 5,106 to 11,975), accounting for 4% of all excess mortality; 1,455 excess homicide deaths (95% CI 708 to 2202, accounting for 0.7% of excess mortality; 5,492 excess deaths due to unintentional accidents occurred (95% CI 85 to 10,899, accounting for 2.6% of excess mortality. Though a non-significantly 135 (95% CI -1361 to 1,630) more MVA deaths were recorded during the study period, a significant decrease in April (525; 95% CI -817 to -233) and significant increases in June-July (965; 95% CI 348 to 1,587) were observed. Suicide deaths were statistically lower than projected by 2,067 (95% CI 941-3,193 fewer deaths).\n\nMeaningExcess deaths from drug overdoses, homicide, and addicents occurred during the pandemic but represented a small fraction of all-cause excess mortality. The excess external causes of death, however, still represent thousands of lives lost.

D.","abstract":"IntroductionThe Philippines is plagued with natural disasters and resulting precipitating factors for disease outbreaks. The developing country has a strong disease surveillance program during and post-disaster phases; however, latent disease contracted during these emergency situations emerges once the Filipinos return to their homes. Coined the social media capital of the world, the Philippines provides an opportunity to evaluate the potential of social media use in disease surveillance during the post-recovery period. By developing and defining a non-traditional method for enhancing detection of infectious diseases post-natural disaster recovery in the Philippines, this research aims to increase the resilience of affected developing countries through advanced passive disease surveillance with minimal cost and high impact.\n\nMethodsWe collected 50 million geo-tagged tweets, weekly case counts for six diseases, and all natural disasters from the Philippines between 2012 and 2013. We compared the predictive capability of various disease lexicon-based time series models (e.g., Twitters BreakoutDetection, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Explanatory Variable [ARIMAX], Multilinear regression, and Logistic regression) and document embeddings (Gensims Doc2Vec).\n\nResultsThe analyses show that the use of only tweets to predict disease outbreaks in the Philippines has varying results depending on which technique is applied, the disease type, and location. Overall, the most consistent predictive results were from the ARIMAX model which showed the significance in tweet value for prediction and a role of disaster in specific instances.\n\nDiscussionOverall, the use of disease\/sick lexicon-filtered tweets as a predictor of disease in the Philippines appears promising. Due to the consistent and large increase use of Twitter within the country, it would be informative to repeat analysis on more recent years to confirm the top method for prediction. In addition, we suggest that a combination disease-specific model would produce the best results. The model would be one where the case counts of a disease are updated periodically along with the continuous monitoring of lexicon-based tweets plus or minus the time from disaster.","date":"2021-03-26","journal":""}

In Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, there were 1015269 COVID-19 confirmed cases, 969424 recovery cases, and 9328 deaths as of 30th Nov. 2020. This paper, therefore, subjected the daily reported COVID-19 cases of these three variables to some statistical models including classical ARIMA, kth SMA-ARIMA, kth WMA-ARIMA, and kth EWMA-ARIMA to study the trend and to provide the long-term forecasting of the confirmed, recovery, and death cases of the novel COVID-19 pandemic in the GCC countries. The data analyzed in this study covered the period starting from the first case of coronavirus reported in each GCC country to Nov 30, 2020. To compute the best parameter estimates, each model was fitted for 90% of the available data in each country, which is called the in-sample forecast or training data, and the remaining 10% was used for the out-of-sample forecast or testing model. The AIC was applied to the training data as a criterion method to select the best model. Furthermore, the statistical measure RMSE was utilized for testing data, and the model with the minimum AIC and minimum RMSE was selected. The main finding, in general, is that the two models WMA-ARIMA and EWMA-ARIMA, besides the cubic linear regression model have given better results for in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts than the classical ARIMA models in fitting the confirmed and recovery cases while the death cases havent specific models.","date":"2021-05-29","journal":""}

The daily number of patients testing positive for COVID-19. We used Poisson regression analysis with sandwich estimator to evaluate the association between election and the spread of COVID-19 infections. For Miyakojima City, we assessed the relationship between election and COVID-19 infections by using the Box-Jenkins autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. We also estimated the instantaneous reproduction number (Rt) in the city. There were 17 cities that met the inclusion criteria. In all models with three types of different lag effects (i.e., 4, 9, and 14 days), election was not a significant predictor of COVID-19 infections in the 17 cities. For Miyakojima City, the autoregressive integrated moving average (0, 0, 0) with a lag of 14 (=14) was the best model. The partial coefficient ({omega}) of the election was 11.91 (95% confidence interval: 3.10-20.72, P<0.001), indicating that the election was associated with an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases 14 days after the election campaign (mean: 12 cases\/day). Rt hovered far above 1 during and after the election campaign in Miyakojima. Although elections were associated with an increased number of COVID-19 cases in Miyakojima, this association was not verified in the analysis including all 17 cities. Therefore, if preventive measures prescribed by election guidelines are followed, elections do not necessarily relate to a spread of COVID-19 as long as the election process does not involve activities necessitating close contact.","date":"2021-06-15","journal":""}

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of social protests on the number and trend of the confirmed COVID-19 cases in some selected Colombian cities where social protests had more intensity.\n\nMethodsWe performed and interrupted time-series analysis (ITSA) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models, based on the confirmed COVID-19 cases in Colombia, between March 1 and May 15, 2021, for Bogota, Cali, Barranquilla, Medellin, and Bucaramanga. The ITSA models estimated the effect of social demonstrations on the number and trend of cases for each city by using Newey-West standard errors. ARIMA models assessed the overall pattern of the series and effect of the intervention. We considered May 2, 2021, as the intervention date for the analysis, five days after social demonstrations started in the country.\n\nFindingsDuring the study period the number of cases by city was 1,014,815 for Bogota, 192,320 for Cali, 175,269 for Barranquilla, 311,904 for Medellin, and 62,512 for Bucaramanga. Heterogeneous results were found among cities. Only for the cities of Cali and Barranquilla statistically significant changes in trend of the number of cases were obtained after the intervention: positive in the first city, negative in the second one. None ARIMA models show evidence of abrupt changes in the trend of the series for any city and intervention effect was only significant for Bucaramanga.\n\nInterpretationSocial protests had a heterogeneous effect on the number and trend of COVID-19 cases. Different effects might be related to the epidemiologic moment of the pandemic and the characteristics of the social protests. Assessing the effect of social protests within a pandemic is complex and there are several methodological limitations. Further analyses are required with longer time-series data.","date":"2021-06-18","journal":""}

We fit generalized additive models to cycle threshold (Ct) value data from our RT-qPCR platform, demonstrating a peak in high viral load, low-Ct value infections temporally coincident with peak epidemic growth rates estimated in real time from publicly-reported incidence data and retrospectively from our own laboratory testing data across three administrative regions. We additionally demonstrate a statistically significant effect of duration of time since infection onset on Ct value, suggesting that Ct value can be used as a biomarker of the stage at which an individual is sampled in the course of an infection trajectory. As an extension, the population-level Ct distribution at a given timepoint can be used to estimate population-level epidemiological dynamics. We illustrate this concept by adopting a recently-developed, nested modeling approach, embedding a within-host viral kinetics model within a population-level Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) framework, to mechanistically estimate epidemic growth rates from cross-sectional Ct distributions across three regions in Madagascar. We find that Ct-derived epidemic growth estimates slightly precede those derived from incidence data across the first epidemic wave, suggesting delays in surveillance and case reporting. Our findings indicate that public reporting of Ct values could offer an important resource for epidemiological inference in low surveillance settings, enabling forecasts of impending incidence peaks in regions with limited case reporting.","date":"2021-07-08","journal":""}

However, where routine immunization is weak, an overreliance on vaccination campaigns may lead to heterogeneous coverage. Here, we assessed the impact of a health system strengthening (HSS) intervention on the relative contribution of routine immunization and outreach activities to reach immunization goals in rural Madagascar.We obtained data from health centers in Ifanadiana district on the monthly number of recommended vaccines (BCG, measles, DTP and Polio) delivered to children, during 2014-2018. We also analyzed data from a district-representative cohort carried out every two years in over 1500 households in 2014-2018. We compared changes inside and outside the HSS catchment in the delivery of recommended vaccines, population-level vaccination coverage, geographic and economic inequalities in coverage, and timeliness of vaccination. The impact of HSS was quantified via mixed-effects logistic regressions. The HSS intervention was associated with a significant increase in immunization rates (Odds Ratio between 1.22 for measles and 1.49 for DTP), which diminished over time. Outreach activities were associated with a doubling in immunization rates, but their effect was smaller in the HSS catchment. Analysis of cohort data revealed that HSS was associated with higher vaccination coverage (Odds Ratio between 1.18 per year of HSS for measles and 1.43 for BCG), a reduction in economic inequality, and a higher proportion of timely vaccinations. Yet, the lower contribution of outreach activities in the HSS catchment was associated with persistent inequalities in geographic coverage, which prevented achieving international coverage targets. Investment in stronger primary care systems can improve vaccination coverage, reduce inequalities and improve the timeliness of vaccination via increases in routine immunizations.\n\nKey questionsO_ST_ABSWhat is already known?C_ST_ABS- Reaching the minimum recommended vaccination coverage of 90% for childhood illnesses remains a substantial challenge for low and middle income countries (LMICs).\n- Understanding how vaccine delivery strategies can be improved to achieve coverage targets in rural areas of LMICs is essential due to the fragility of health systems and associated health budgets.\n- While evidence exists on the impact of outreach activities and other targeted interventions aimed at improving immunization coverage, it is unclear how strengthening local health systems can help improve key indicators of vaccination coverage, via its different impacts on routine and outreach immunizations.\n\n\nWhat are the new findings?- A health systems strengthening (HSS) intervention in a rural district of Madagascar improved overall vaccination coverage, reduced economic inequalities in vaccination coverage, and increased the proportion of timely vaccinations via an increase in routine immunizations.\n- The contribution of outreach activities was lower in the HSS catchment area than in the rest of the district, which was associated with a persistence of geographic inequalities in vaccination coverage.\n\n\nWhat do the new findings imply?- Strengthening local health systems can help improve key indicators of vaccination coverage in rural, low resource settings, even when those interventions do not target specifically vaccine improvements themselves.\n- Explicit efforts are still necessary in areas undergoing HSS to vaccinate children in remote areas so that immunization goals can be reached.","date":"2021-07-22","journal":""}

The same exponential dynamics has been observed between January and March, 2021. The forecast of new cases and death recorded daily is crucial so that health experts and citizens can be guided in order to avoid escalation of the pandemic. We propose a deterministic method to predict the basic reproduction number Ro of first and second wave of COVID-19 cases in Kuwait and also to forecast the daily new cases and death of the pandemic in the country. Forecasting has been done using ARIMA model, Exponential smoothing model, Holts method, Prophet forecasting model and machine learning models like log-linear, polynomial and support vector regressions. The results presented aligned with other methods used to predict Ro in first and second waves and the forecasting clearly shows the trend of the pandemic in Kuwait. The deterministic prediction of Ro is a good forecasting tool available during the exponential phase of the contagion, which shows an increasing trend during the beginning of the first and second waves of the pandemic in Kuwait.","date":"2021-07-30","journal":""}

It is recommended that at least 80% of a countrys population should be within two hours of a facility with essential surgery and anesthetic services. In order to strengthen health systems to achieve this goal, there needs to be an understanding of the time necessary for populations to reach a hospital. The goal of this study was to develop methods that accurately estimate referral and pre-hospital time for rural health districts in LMICs. We used these estimates to assess how the local geography can limit the impact of a strengthened referral program in a rural district of Madagascar.\n\nMethodsWe developed a database containing 1) travel speed in a subset of routes by foot and motorized vehicles in Ifanadiana District; 2) a full mapping of all roads, footpaths and households in the district; and 3) remotely sensed data on terrain, land cover and climatic characteristics. We used this information to calibrate estimates of referral and pre-hospital time based on shortest route algorithms and statistical models of local travel speed. We compared these estimates with those from other commonly used methods in geographic accessibility modeling. Finally, we studied the impact of referral time on the evolution of the number of referrals completed by each health center in the district in 2014-2020 via generalized linear mixed models, using model estimates to predict the impact on referral numbers of strategies aimed at reducing referral time for underserved populations.\n\nResultsAbout 10% of the population lived less than two hours from the hospital, and more than half lived over four hours away, with variable access depending on climatic conditions. Only the four health centers (out of 21) located near the paved road had referral times to the hospital within one hour, which contributed over 75% of all 8,464 hospital referrals. Referral time remained the main barrier limiting the number of referrals despite health system strengthening efforts. The addition of two new referral centers is estimated to triple the population living within two hours from a center with higher acute care capacity and nearly double the number of referrals expected.\n\nConclusionThis study demonstrates how adapting geographic accessibility modeling methods to local scales can occur through improving the precision of travel time estimates and pairing them with data on health facility data. Such information can substantially improve the design of a local health system to overcome existing barriers to care and achieve universal health coverage.","date":"2021-08-08","journal":""}

Here we report the identification of homozygous loss of function variants in the primate-specific gene ZNF808 as a cause of pancreatic agenesis. ZNF808 is a member of the KRAB zinc finger protein (KZFPs) family, a large and rapidly evolving group of epigenetic silencers that target transposable elements. We show that loss of ZNF808 in vitro results in aberrant activation of many transposable elements it normally represses during early pancreas development. This results in inappropriate specification of cell fate with induction of genes associated with liver endoderm and a loss of pancreatic identity. We show that ZNF808 and its transposable element targets play a critical role in cell fate specification during human pancreatic development. This is the first report of loss of a primate-specific gene causing a congenital developmental disease and highlights the essential role of ZNF808 for pancreatic development in humans.","date":"2021-08-23","journal":""}

Resulting unemployment, income loss, poverty, and social isolation, coupled with daily reports of dire news about the COVID-19 pandemic, could serve as catalysts for increased self-harm deaths (SHD). This ecological study examined whether observed SHD counts were higher than predicted SHD counts during the pandemic period in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec. The study also explored whether SHD counts during the pandemic were affected by lockdown severity (measured using the lockdown stringency index [LSI]) and COVID-19 case numbers. We utilized publicly available SHD data from January 2018 through November 2020, and employed AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modelling, to predict SHD during the COVID-19 period (March 21 to November 28, 2020). We used Poisson and negative binomial regression to assess ecological associations between the LSI and COVID-19 case numbers, controlling for seasonality, and SHD counts during the COVID-19 period. On average, observed SHD counts were lower than predicted counts during this period (p < 0.05 [except Alberta]). Additionally, LSI and COVID-19 case numbers were not statistically significantly associated with SHD counts.","date":"2021-10-14","journal":""}

We first used elastic net regression to identify potential virus interactions and further examined the robustness of the found interactions by comparing the performance of Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models with and without the interactions. We then used the models to compute counterfactual estimates of cumulative incidence and estimate the reduction during the COVID-19 pandemic period from March 2020 to May 2021, for each virus.\n\nResultsWe identified potential interactions for three endemic human coronaviruses (CoV-NL63, CoV-HKU, and CoV-OC43), parainfluenza (PIV)-1, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). We found significant reductions (by ~70-90%) in cumulative incidence of CoV-OC43, CoV-229E, human metapneumovirus, PIV-2, PIV-4, RSV, and influenza virus during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We propose a procedure that increases the accuracy of molecular detection of live pneumococci in polymicrobial respiratory samples.\n\nMethodsCulture and qPCR methods were applied to detect S. pneumoniae and pneumococcal serotypes in 1549 nasopharyngeal samples collected in the Netherlands (n=972) and England (n=577) from 946 toddlers and 603 adults, and in paired oropharyngeal samples collected exclusively from 319 Dutch adults. Samples with no live pneumococci isolated at primary diagnostic culture yet generating pneumococcus-specific signal in qPCRs were re-examined with a second, qPCR-guided culture. Optimal Cq cut-offs for positivity in qPCRs were determined via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis using isolation of live pneumococci from the primary and qPCR-guided cultures as reference.\n\nResultsDetection of S. pneumoniae and pneumococcal serotypes with qPCRs in cultured (culture-enriched) nasopharyngeal samples exhibited near-perfect agreement with conventional culture (Cohens kappa: 0.95). Molecular methods also displayed increased sensitivity of detection for multiple serotype carriage. Among paired samples from adults, the sensitivity of S. pneumoniae detection in primary nasopharyngeal plus oropharyngeal cultures was significantly lower compared with molecular detection in both culture-enriched samples together (p<0.0001) and also in culture-enriched oropharyngeal samples alone (p<0.05).\n\nConclusionsThe sensitivity of S. pneumoniae carriage surveillance can be greatly improved by complementing conventional culture with qPCR and vice versa. The specificity of molecular methods for the detection of live pneumococci can be enhanced by incorporating statistical procedures based on ROC curve analysis.

We aimed to study the effect of this intervention on the incidence of cases and hospital admissions.\n\nMethodsThe main outcome was the weekly averaged incidence of COVID-19 confirmed cases and hospital admissions. We performed Negative Binomial Segmented Regression (NBSR) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) analyses for the four countries (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales), and fitted Difference-in-Differences (DiD) models to compare the latter three to England, where COVID-19 certification was imposed the latest.\n\nFindingsNBSR methods suggested COVID-19 certification led to a decrease in the incidence of cases in Northern Ireland, but not in hospitalizations. In Wales, they also caused a decrease in the incidence of cases but not in hospital admissions. In Scotland, we observed a decrease in both cases and admissions. ARIMA models confirmed these results. The DiD model showed that the intervention decreased the incidence of COVID compared to England in all countries except Wales, in October. Then, the incidence rate of cases already had a decreasing tendency, as well as in England, hence a particular impact of Covid Passport was less obvious. In Wales, the model coefficients were 2.2 (95% CI -6.24,10.70) for cases and -0.144 (95% CI -0.248, -0.039) for admissions in October and -7.75 (95% CI -13.1, -2.46) for cases and -0.169 (95% CI-0.308, -0.031) for admissions in November.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) pathogenesis appears to be a mix of genetic susceptibility, microbial populations, and immune triggers such as infections. Given the perceived role of infection in pathogenesis, decreased incidence of all infections during the pandemic secondary to non-pharmaceutical interventions should decrease IBD incidence rates. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the Covid-19 pandemic and IBD presentation in NYC using data from new diagnoses at a consortium of institutions.\n\nUsing EMR systems all diagnoses at 4 collaborating institutions were retrieved from 2015-2021. We fit time series model (ARIMA) to the quarterly number of cases of each disease for January 2016-March 2020 and forecast the subsequent 21 months. We not only did not observe a decline in pediatric IBD secondary to absent viral illness but noted a statistically significant increase in Crohns Disease approximately 6 months after the initial 2020 COVID wave in NYC, and trends suggesting increases overall in IBD diagnoses above the existing trend towards increased disease presentation that pre-dated the pandemic. This data suggests that there may be a linkage between SARS-nCoV2 infection rates and subsequent pediatric IBD presentation, warranting further evaluation in the aftermath of the Omicron wave.","date":"2022-03-27","journal":""}

M.; Luo, R.","abstract":"We analyze an ensemble of n-sub-epidemic modeling for forecasting the trajectory of epidemics and pandemics. These ensemble modeling approaches, and models that integrate sub-epidemics to capture complex temporal dynamics, have demonstrated powerful forecasting capability. This modeling framework can characterize complex epidemic patterns, including plateaus, epidemic resurgences, and epidemic waves characterized by multiple peaks of different sizes. We systematically assess their calibration and short-term forecasting performance in short-term forecasts for the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA from late April 2020 to late February 2022. We compare their performance with two commonly used statistical ARIMA models. The best fit sub-epidemic model and three ensemble models constructed using the top-ranking sub-epidemic models consistently outperformed the ARIMA models in terms of the weighted interval score (WIS) and the coverage of the 95% prediction interval across the 10-, 20-, and 30-day short-term forecasts. In the 30-day forecasts, the average WIS ranged from 377.6 to 421.3 for the sub-epidemic models, whereas it ranged from 439.29 to 767.05 for the ARIMA models. Across 98 short-term forecasts, the ensemble model incorporating the top four ranking sub-epidemic models (Ensemble(4)) outperformed the (log) ARIMA model 66.3% of the time, and the ARIMA model 69.4% of the time in 30-day ahead forecasts in terms of the WIS. Ensemble(4) consistently yielded the best performance in terms of the metrics that account for the uncertainty of the predictions. This framework could be readily applied to investigate the spread of epidemics and pandemics beyond COVID-19, as well as other dynamic growth processes found in nature and society that would benefit from short-term predictions.\n\nSummaryThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need to develop reliable tools to forecast the trajectory of epidemics and pandemics in near real-time. We describe and apply an ensemble n-sub-epidemic modeling framework for forecasting the trajectory of epidemics and pandemics. We systematically assess its calibration and short-term forecasting performance in weekly 10-30 days ahead forecasts for the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA from late April 2020 to late February 2022 and compare its performance with two different statistical ARIMA models. This framework demonstrated reliable forecasting performance and substantially outcompeted the ARIMA models. The forecasting performance was consistently best for the ensemble sub-epidemic models incorporating a higher number of top-ranking sub-epidemic models. The ensemble model incorporating the top four ranking sub-epidemic models consistently yielded the best performance, particularly in terms of the coverage rate of the 95% prediction interval and the weighted interval score.

There are indications that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted vaccination rates globally, but systematic studies on this are still lacking in Canada. This study aims to add knowledge on the effect of the pandemic on pneumococcal vaccination rates of children using self-reported immunization data entered into the CANImmunize digital vaccination tool.\n\nMethodologyAn interrupted time series analysis was conducted on aggregated monthly enrollment of children on the platform (2016-2021) and their pneumococcal immunization series completion rates (2016-2020). Predicted trends before and after the onset of the COVID-19 related restriction (March 1, 2020) were compared by means of an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA).\n\nResultsPandemic restrictions were associated with changes in self-reported pneumococcal immunization rates amongst the users of the CANImmunize platform. The monthly enrollment of children on the platform decreased by - 1177.52 records (95% CI: -1865.47, - 489.57), with a continued decrease of 80.84 records each month. Self-reported pneumococcal immunization series completion rates had an immediate increase of 14.57% (95% CI 4.64, 24.51) followed by a decrease of -3.54% each month.\n\nConclusionThe onset of the COVID-19 related restrictions impacted enrollment of children in the CANImmunize digital immunization platform, and an overall decrease in self-reported pneumococcal immunization series completion rates. Our findings support that efforts to increase catch-up immunization campaigns so that children who could not get scheduled immunization during the pandemic are not missed.","date":"2022-06-22","journal":""}

Furthermore, using the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test, the predictive accuracy of NNAR (1,1,2) [12] versus ARIMA-ANN, and ARIMA-ANN versus ARIMA (0,0,1,1,0,1,12) models were significantly different, p<0.001, respectively. The 12-month forecasts showed a TB prevalence of 175 to 198 cases per 100,000 children in Homa bay and Turkana Counties in 2022.\n\nConclusionThe hybrid (ARIMA-ANN) model produces better predictive and forecast accuracy compared to the single ARIMA and ANN models. The findings show evidence that the prevalence of TB among children below 15 years in Homa bay and Turkana Counties is significantly under-reported and is potentially higher than the national average.","date":"2022-07-10","journal":""}

S.","abstract":"PurposeThe objectives of this study were to examine the overall utilisation of systematic antibiotics and the impact of the launch of the antimicrobial resistance action plan in older adults (65 years or more) living in New Zealand between 2005 and 2019, using data from a national database (Pharmaceutical collections), stratified by antibiotic class, patient age, and sex.\n\nMethodsPopulation-level systemic antibiotic dispensing data for older adults in New Zealand was analysed using repeated cross-sectional analysis between 01\/01\/2005 and 31\/12\/2019. Data were extracted on the prescribed systemic antibiotics using a unique identifier for each case. Antibiotic utilisation was measured in DDD\/TOPD values. In addition, an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis using the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models was performed to determine the impact of the antimicrobial resistance action plan.\n\nResultsMost of the antibiotic classes included in this study showed a significant overall decrease in utilisation ranging from 38.64% for sulphonamides to 80.64% for fluoroquinolones compared to 2005. Systemic antibiotic utilisation decreased by 49.6% from the predicted usage between January 2018 and December 2019 following the launch of the antimicrobial resistance action plan. ARIMA model supported the reduction in utilisation with a step change of -0.2206 and slope change of -0.0029.\n\nConclusionsThe ITS analysis has demonstrated that the intervention may have hugely impacted the antibiotic utilisation rate among older adults. Further studies are required to determine whether the reduced consumption rates of antibiotics are associated with reduced rates of antibiotic-associated adverse drug events such as acute kidney injury and haematological abnormalities.","date":"2023-02-21","journal":""}

Samples were collected between October 2020 and January 2021 from n=197 adults and n=118 children of which n=176 adults and n=98 children had a complete set of ten samples collected within 42 days since enrolment. Time-dependent Cox models were used to evaluate the associations between SARS-CoV-2 and pneumococcal carriage.\n\nResultsIn the entire cohort, cumulative pneumococcal carriage and SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were 58% and 65%, respectively. Pneumococcal abundances were associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR 1.14, 95% CI, 1.01 - 1.29, P=0.04) and delayed clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection (HR 0.90, 95% CI, 0.82 - 0.99, P=0.03). Elevated viral loads were observed among pneumococcal carriers and individuals with high overall bacterial 16S abundances, however, there were no longitudinal differences in viral loads in linear mixed-effects models.

Results from the current study suggest that pneumococcal carriers may have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and high pneumococcal abundances and 16S abundances may be associated with elevated viral loads and delayed clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","date":"2023-02-21","journal":""}

High quality, population-representative studies in Africa are rare and tend to be conducted in national capitals or large cities, leaving a substantial gap in our understanding of the impact of COVID-19 in rural, low-resource settings. Here, we estimated the spatio-temporal morbidity and mortality burden associated with COVID-19 in a rural health district of Madagascar until the first half of 2021.\n\nMethodsWe integrated a nested seroprevalence study within a pre-existing longitudinal cohort conducted in a representative sample of 1600 households in Ifanadiana District, Madagascar. Socio-demographic and health information was collected in combination with dried blood spots for about 6500 individuals of all ages, which were analysed to detect IgG and IgM antibodies against four specific proteins of SARS-CoV2 in bead-based multiplex immunoassay. We evaluated spatio-temporal patterns in COVID-19 infection history and its associations with several geographic, socio-economic and demographic factors via logistic regressions.\n\nResultsEighteen percent of people had been infected by April-June 2021, with seroprevalence increasing with individuals age. COVID-19 primarily spread along the only paved road and in major towns during the first epidemic wave, subsequently spreading along secondary roads during the second wave to more remote areas. Wealthier individuals and those with occupations such as commerce and formal employment were at higher risk of being infected in the first wave. Adult mortality increased in 2020, particularly for older men for whom it nearly doubled up to nearly 40 deaths per 1000. Less than 10% of mortality in this period could be directly attributed to COVID-19 deaths given known infection fatality ratios and observed seroprevalence in the district.\n\nConclusionOur study provides a very granular understanding on COVID-19 transmission and mortality in a rural population of sub-Saharan Africa and suggests that the disease burden in these areas may have been substantially underestimated.","date":"2023-03-24","journal":""}

[1]. Analyzing data across both time and location is crucial in understanding disease dynamics, allowing for the identification of patterns such as temporal clustering, detection of high-incidence areas, characterization of disease spread, measurement of temporal synchrony, and forecasting future incidence rates. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of neural networks in addressing this problem. Reservoir Computing, ARIMA, and various types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have demonstrated success in tackling complex time-series issues. We assess several models based on different RNN architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bidirectional GRU (BGRU), and compare their performance. We use a deep learning approach based on Reservoir Computing to predict chickenpox counts based on past incidence rates. We implement all the aforementioned neural network architectures for fore-casting chickenpox incidence rates and compare their prediction accuracy. Our results indicate that Reservoir Computing prediction models outperform all other models trained on the same data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Reservoir Computing prediction models are more efficient and quicker to train and deploy in epidemiology.","date":"2023-04-26","journal":""}

In the Sekyere East district, an increasing trend of children with severe anaemia leading to haemotransfusion has been observed. Over a three-month period (June to August 2022) approximately one hundred (100) children were haemotransfused due to severe anaemia in the Effiduase district hospital. This quantitative oriented study adopted the descriptive cross-sectional study design. Specifically, the study sought to explore the prevalence of childhood anaemia and its associated factors in the district. Purposive sampling technique which is a non-probability (non-randomized) was used to select children and their guardians to partake in the study. SPSS statistical software version 25 was used to analyze quantitative data of this study and data were presented in frequencies using tables. This study has accentuated high prevalence of anaemia in the Sekyere East district looking at the various findings brought to light by the Haemoglobin (Hb) blood analysis, Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) blood tests and the Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin (MCH) test results. The findings from the study have also shown that malaria in children is significantly associated with the onset of childhood anaemia. The study additionally revealed moderate nutritional intake of food products very rich in iron, vitamin B12 and folate nutrients necessary to curb anaemia in children. In conclusion, study findings therefore underscore the need for multi-faceted approaches that address both malaria control and nutrition in order to reduce anaemia among the children in the Sekyere East district.","date":"2023-04-28","journal":""}

However, the link between a defecation pattern and future adverse events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between defecation patterns during hospitalization and future cardiovascular events in patients with ACS.\n\nMethodsThis two-center retrospective observational cohort study included 1949 patients hospitalized for ACS between 2012 and 2019. For a comprehensive assessment of defecation in a general ward, we examined three indicators: \"frequency of non-defecation days,\" \"consecutive non-defecation days,\" and \"maximum daily defecation frequency,\" in addition to \"average daily defecation frequency\". Patients were divided according to Youden index-derived cutoff values of each defecation frequency indicators. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke.\n\nResultsDuring the follow-up period (median, 48 months; IQR 30-74 months), 405 of 1949 (20.8%) patients developed the primary outcome. In total, 229 patients died (96 cardiovascular deaths and 133 non-cardiovascular deaths), and there were 142, 57, 28, and 113 patients with non-fatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal ischemic stroke, nonfatal hemorrhagic stroke, and hospitalized due to heart failure, respectively.

Descriptive analyses were used to analyze changes in the prevalence and burden of edentulism, gender and age distribution between 1990 and 2019. In addition, we used an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to predict the trend of disease burden for Chinese adults with edentulism between 2020 and 2030.\n\nRESULTSThe incidence, prevalence, and rate of YLDs in adults with edentulism in China showed an increasing trend from 1990 to 2019. In 2019, the incidence was 251.20 per 100,000, the prevalence was 4512.78 per 100,000, and the YLDs were 123.44 per 100,000, marking increases of 20.58%, 94.18%, and 93.12% from 1990. Males experienced a higher increase than females. However, the standardized rates decreased over the same period. The ARIMA model predicts a subsequent upward and then downward trend for all indicators between 2019 and 2030, except for the standardized incidence rate which remained essentially unchanged. Specifically, the incidence is predicted to decrease from 388.93 to 314.40 per 100,000, prevalence from 4512.78 to 3049.70 per 100,000, and YLDs from 123.44 to 103.44 per 100,000. The standardized prevalence and YLDs rates are also expected to decrease.\n\nCONCLUSIONThe burden of edentulism in China is projected to show an increasing trend from 2020 to 2022 and a decreasing trend from 2023 to 2030. Despite the decline in the burden of disease associated with edentulism in China, many problems remain to be solved.","date":"2023-12-26","journal":""}

J.; Ankapong, P. P.; Mensah, C.; Munkaila, L. I.; Addo, h. O.","abstract":"BackgroundUncontaminated water and adequate sanitation facilities are of major importance for limiting the incidence of infectious diseases. In Ghana, about 80% of people still do not have access to proper sanitation, including latrines, which have dramatic consequences on human health, dignity, security and the environment. Potable water coverage in the Sunyani municipality stands at 47 percent in the urban areas and 33.5 percent in the rural areas. Many of the households in the Sunyani Municipality do not have toilet facilities, putting pressure on the few existing public toilet facilities available.\n\nMethodsUsing a simple random sampling technique, a total of 500 households were selected for the study. Structured questionnaires were used to collect quantitative data. In addition, a hand-held global positioning system (GPS) receiver was used to pick geographic coordinates of various water and toilet facilities. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS version 25.\n\nResultsThe results indicate inconsistencies in the spatial distribution of toilet and water facilities with an average distance of 33 meters. The study further revealed the current system of public toilets operating in the towns cannot be resource intensive to meet households targets because they do not satisfy sanitation needs (p<0.001). On the contrary, it tends to rather create even more problems, thereby encouraging open defecation. Also, their impact on human and environmental health needs to be taken into account.\n\nConclusionAccess to potable water and improved toilet facility remains a challenge as most households do not have toilets within their homes. Financial constraints, distance travelled and poor condition of public toilets were the main factors determining utilization of public toilet facilities. The types of toilet facilities used in the Municipality influence disease prevalence. The prevalence of cholera, diarrhoea, typhoid, skin rashes and eye infections were as a result of improper or no washing of hands.","date":"2023-12-28","journal":""}

E.; Weinberg, R.; de Janon Quevedo, L.; Galleguillos, A.; Koch, E.","abstract":"BackgroundThis study estimated the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on maternal death causes in Chile during the outbreak peak between 2020 and 2021.\n\nMaterials and MethodsA natural experiment was conducted using official data on maternal deaths and live births (LBs) between 1997 and 2021. Trend changes in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) were assessed using segmented regression. The effects of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak were evaluated using interrupted time series (ITS) and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to forecast the expected rates on MMR and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).\n\nFindingsITS analysis revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak impacted the MMR due to indirect causes, with a greater increase in indirect nonrespiratory causes than respiratory causes. The ARIMA forecast was consistent with ITS, showing that the expected MMR for indirect causes was substantially lower than the observed rates (9.65 in 2020 and 7.46\/100,000 LBs in 2021). The expected MMR was 3.44 in 2020 and 1.55 in 2021. For nonrespiratory causes, the observed values of the MMR for 2020 (8.77\/100.000 LBs) and 2021 (7.46\/100.000 LBs) doubled the prediction 4.02 (95% CI: 0.44-7.61) and 3.83 (95% CI: -0.12-7.79). No significant effect was found on direct obstetrical deaths.\n\nInterpretationDuring 2020-2021, there was a rise in the MMR in Chile attributable to SARS-CoV-2. The pandemic contributed to an escalation in the MMR due to indirect causes, particularly nonrespiratory and infectious causes, suggesting that the risk of pregnant women to SARS-CoV-2 was increased from previous comorbidities.","date":"2024-01-17","journal":""}

To ensure that community health programs lead to equitable geographic access to care, the WHO recommends adapting the target population and workload of community health workers (CHWs) according to the local geographic context and population size of the communities they serve. Geographic optimization could be particularly beneficial for those activities that require CHWs to visit households door-to-door for last mile delivery of care. The goal of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility and utility of geographic optimization in the context of community health programs in rural areas of the developing world. We developed a decision-making tool based on participatory mapping and route optimization algorithms in order to inform the micro-planning and implementation of two kinds of community health interventions requiring door-to-door delivery: mass distribution campaigns and proactive community case management (proCCM) programs. We applied the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) algorithm to optimize the on-foot routes that CHWs take to visit households in their catchment, using a geographic dataset obtained from participatory mapping on OpenStreetMap comprising over 100,000 buildings and 20,000 km of footpaths in the rural district of Ifanadiana, Madagascar. We found that personnel-day requirements ranged from less than 15 to over 60 per CHW catchment for mass distribution campaigns, and from less than 5 to over 20 for proCCM programs, assuming 1 visit per month. To facilitate local use of VRPTW algorithms by operational teams, we developed an \"e-health\" platform to visualize resource requirements, CHW optimal schedules and itineraries according to customizable intervention designs and hypotheses. Further development and scale-up of these tools could help optimize community health programs and other last mile delivery activities, in line with WHO recommendations, linking a new era of big data analytics with the most basic forms of frontline care in resource poor areas.","date":"2024-02-20","journal":""}

In an effort to mitigate the spread of this highly infectious disease, a range of measures, including social distancing, mask-wearing, lockdowns, and vaccination campaigns, have been implemented. However, despite these extensive efforts, the persistent transmission of the virus can be attributed to a combination of vaccine hesitancy among certain individuals and the emergence of new viral strains. To effectively manage the ongoing pandemic, healthcare providers and government officials rely on infectious disease modeling to anticipate and secure the necessary resources. Accurate short-term case number forecasting is of paramount importance for healthcare systems.\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, numerous models have been employed to forecast the number of confirmed cases. In this study, we undertake a comparative analysis of six time-series techniques: Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), Holt-Winters Double Exponential Smoothing Additive (HWDESA), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), with regard to their modeling and forecasting capabilities. SMA, EWMA, and HWDESA were employed for predictive modeling, while the ARIMA, SARIMA, and RNN models were utilized for case number forecasting. A comprehensive grid search was carried out to determine the optimal parameter combinations for both the ARIMA and SARIMA models. Our research findings demonstrate that the Holt-Winters Double Exponential model outperforms both the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average and Simple Moving Average in predicting the number of cases. On the other hand, the RNN model surpasses conventional time-series models such as ARIMA and SARIMA in terms of its forecasting accuracy. The finding of this study emphasizes the importance of accurately predicting the number of COVID-19 cases, given the substantial loss of lives caused by both the virus itself and the societal responses to it. Equipping healthcare managers with precise tools like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) can enable them to forecast future cases more accurately and enhance their preparedness for effective response.","date":"2024-03-04","journal":""}

In recent years, stringent measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 have led to considerable disruptions of healthcare services for TB in many countries. The extent to which these measures have affected TB testing, treatment initiation and outcomes has not been comprehensively assessed. We aimed to estimate TB healthcare service disruptions occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, India, and South Africa. We obtained country-level TB programme and laboratory data and used autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) time-series models to estimate healthcare service disruptions with respect to TB testing, treatment initiation, and treatment outcomes. We quantified disruptions as the percentage difference between TB indicator data observed during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with values for a hypothetical no-COVID scenario, predicted through forecasting of trends during a three-year pre-pandemic period. Annual estimates for 2020-2022 were derived from aggregated monthly data. We estimated that in 2020, the number of bacteriological tests conducted for TB diagnosis was 24.3% (95% uncertainty interval: 8.4%;36.6%) lower in Brazil, 27.8% (19.8;3 4.8%) lower in India, and 32.0% (28.9%;34.9%) lower in South Africa compared with values predicted for the no-COVID scenario. TB treatment initiations were 17.4% (13.9%;20.6%) lower than predicted in Brazil, 43.3% (39.8%;46.4%) in India, and 27.0% (15.2%;36.3%) in South Africa.

Several train-test splits were defined simulating a prospective, weekly acquisition of data on new admissions. First, we trained Light Gradient Boosting Machines (LGBM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models to generate predictions on length of stay (LOS) for each admission. Based on predicted LOS, timeseries were built and predictions on daily hospital discharges, by ward, seven days into the future, were created employing diverse forecasting techniques. Mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and observed discharges was used to measure the accuracy of predictions. Discharge predictions were also categorized as successful if they did not exceed by 10% the mean number of hospital daily discharges.\n\nRESULTSLGBM slightly outperformed MLP in 25 weekly LOS predictions (MAE 4.7{+\/-}0.7 vs 4.9{+\/-}0.7 days, p<0.001).

A.; Krumholz, H.","abstract":"IntroductionOn September 1, 2021, Texas enacted Senate Bill 8 (SB8), a law banning abortions after the detection of fetal heart activity, without exceptions for early detectable fetal abnormalities with low survival probability. The effect on neonatal mortality is unknown.\n\nMethodsWe deployed difference-in-differences (primary analysis), and Joinpoint and seasonal autoregressive moving integrated averages (sensitivity analyses) to determine whether all-cause mortality among Texas neonates increased after SB8 was enacted, and compared the findings to states with permissive abortion laws. Changes in mortality due to congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities were also measured.\n\nResultsCompared with states where abortion remained legal, approximately 177 all-cause excess neonatal deaths (2.3 per 10,000 births, interaction p<0.003) occurred in Texas. A sensitivity analysis using Joinpoint logistic regression spontaneously identified a mortality trend change in Texas coinciding with SB8 enactment. Approximately 113 excess deaths (1.5 per 10,000 births, interaction p<0.001) due to congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities occurred among Texas neonates after SB8 enactment. Compared to expected deaths based on prior internal trends (sARIMA), Texas recorded 289 (95% CI 18-559) excess neonatal deaths (3.7 per 10,000 births; 95% CI 0.2-7.2) in 2022-2023. A preliminary analysis of post-SB8 shares of neonates listed as \"not alive\" on birth certificates by race\/ethnicity found increased relative contributions from non-Hispanic White and Hispanic populations.\n\nConclusionTexas SB8 was responsible for between 177-289 excess neonatal deaths from Quarter 4, 2021-Quarter 4, 2023. These results suggest that if other SB8-like abortion bans are enacted, increases in neonatal mortality may occur elsewhere.","date":"2024-06-27","journal":""}
{"title":"Lower levels of household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 VOC Omicron compared to Wild-type: an interplay between transmissibility and immune status","doi":"10.1101\/2024.07.16.24310515","authors":"Winkel, A.; Kozanli, E.; Haverkort, M.; Euser, S.; Sluiter-Post, J.; Mariman, R.; Vogelzang, A.; de Bakker, J.; Lap, C. R.; van Houten, M.; Eggink, D.; van Lelyveld, S.","abstract":"BackgroundKnowledge of SARS-CoV-2 household transmission dynamics guides infection control and vaccination measures. This household cohort study prospectively assessed the impact of both the Omicron BA.2 variant and immunity on household transmission using dense saliva sampling and sequence analysis.\n\nMethodsHouseholds consisting of a PCR-confirmed index and at least two household members were enrolled in March and April 2022 during the Omicron BA.2 wave in the Netherlands. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was performed on ten consecutive saliva samples. Serum-antibodies were measured at baseline and day 42. Whole genome sequencing was performed for phylogenetic analysis, followed by sensitivity analysis, to correct for multiple household introductions and index definition. Results were compared with the identical, early-pandemic and pre- immunisation predecessor study.\n\nResultsSixty-seven households were included, consisting of 241 individuals (median age 33.0 years). Maximum household Secondary Attack Rate (SAR) was 59.7%, per-person SAR 41.5%. Underage indexes were more likely to transmit. Transmission was negatively affected by household members immunity. Phylogenetic analysis showed multiple introductions in four households. Sensitivity analysis resulted in a minimal household SAR of 51.0% and per-person SAR of 28.5%.\n\nConclusionsThe Omicron BA.2 variant is highly transmissible within households. Nevertheless, transmission rates are lower than our pre-immunisation reported ancestral rates: household SAR decreased from 88.2% to 59.7%, per-person SAR from 64.3% to 41.5%, implying immunity reduces transmission, even for a more transmittable variant. Regardless of immune status, children have a crucial role in Omicron household transmission. Intensive sampling and phylogenetic analysis are essential to correctly calculate transmission rate, especially in times of minimal behavioural restrictions.","date":"2024-07-16","journal":""}

Two of the most often recommended analytical approaches to interrupted time series analysis are autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and Generalized Additive Models (GAM). We conducted simulation tests to determine the performance differences between ARIMA and GAM methodology across different policy effect sizes, with or without seasonality, and with or without misspecification of policy variables. We found that ARIMA exhibited more consistent results under certain conditions, such as with different policy effect sizes, with or without seasonality, while GAM were more robust when the model was misspecified. Given these findings, the variation between the models underscores the need for careful model selection and validation in health policy studies.","date":"2024-08-02","journal":""}

Our study investigates the prognostic significance of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) and various immune gene signatures in HCC using an innovative combination of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. Time series data were utilized to apply an ARIMA model that captures the temporal dynamics of CCL5 expression. This models residual was integrated with immune signature expression data, including lymphocytes and macrophages, to extract features using a CNN model. Our study demonstrates that CNN-extracted features yield a statistically more robust association with patient survival compared to the traditional median split method, which primarily focuses on single-gene analysis. Specifically, CNN-extracted features from CD8 T cells and effector T cells resulted in a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.7324 (p = 0.0008) with log-rank p-value (0.0131), underscoring their pivotal role in the anti-tumor immune response. This methodology highlights the superior prognostic value obtained through integrated multi-gene analyses, providing deeper insights into tumor-immune interactions than conventional single-gene approaches. Moreover, clustering immune genes based on non-parametric correlations unveiled distinct survival patterns. A cluster comprising B cells, Th2 cells, T cells, and NK cells exhibited a moderate protective effect (HR: 0.8714, p = 0.1093) alongside a significant log-rank p-value (0.0233). However, the cluster, including granulocytes, Tregs, macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, showed no significant survival association, highlighting the intricate immune regulation within the tumor microenvironment. These findings emphasize the necessity of incorporating temporal dynamics and synergistic immune gene interactions for more accurate prognostic evaluations. Our integrated ARIMA-CNN framework represents a significant advancement, leveraging both linear and nonlinear modeling to uncover the dynamic influence of multiple immune genes. This framework holds excellent potential for identifying robust biomarkers and personalizing immunotherapy strategies, ultimately paving the way for innovative cancer management solutions.","date":"2024-12-10","journal":""}

Unfortunately, most clinical trials fail to differentiate the effects of treatments on the primary symptoms of major depression, partially because they rely on fixed outcome measures such as total symptom severity scores or remission rates.\n\nMethodsWe performed a comprehensive analysis of the STAR*D trial with the Supervised Varimax (SV) algorithm incorporating post-model selection inference in order to learn outcome measures that differentiate between antidepressants. We also ran the algorithm on an independent clinical trial called CO-MED.\n\nOutcomesWe differentiated bupropion and mirtazapine from multiple other antidepressants in STAR*D with replication in every relevant trial level. We further differentiated bupropion augmentation from mirtazapine augmentation in CO-MED. In particular, bupropion monotherapy had a greater therapeutic effect on hypersomnia than venlafaxine monotherapy in Levels 2 and 2A of STAR*D (n = 686, difference = 0.384, pFWER = 0.007). Bupropion augmentation outperformed buspirone augmentation in Level 2, especially in patients with increased weight, increased appetite and fatigue (n = 520, difference = -0.322, pFWER = 0.005). In contrast, mirtazapine monotherapy had greater therapeutic effects on insomnia, decreased weight and decreased appetite than nortriptyline monotherapy in Level 3 (n = 214, difference = 0.401, pFWER = 0.022).

Unfortunately, most clinical trials fail to differentiate the effects of treatments on the primary symptoms of major depression, partially because they rely on fixed outcome measures such as total symptom severity scores or remission rates.\n\nMethodsWe performed a comprehensive analysis of the STAR*D trial with the Supervised Varimax (SV) algorithm incorporating post-model selection inference in order to learn outcome measures that differentiate between antidepressants. We also ran the algorithm on an independent clinical trial called CO-MED.\n\nOutcomesWe differentiated bupropion and mirtazapine from multiple other antidepressants in STAR*D with replication in every relevant trial level. We further differentiated bupropion augmentation from mirtazapine augmentation in CO-MED. In particular, bupropion monotherapy had a greater therapeutic effect on hypersomnia than venlafaxine monotherapy in Levels 2 and 2A of STAR*D (n = 686, difference = 0.384, pFWER = 0.007). Bupropion augmentation outperformed buspirone augmentation in Level 2, especially in patients with increased weight, increased appetite and fatigue (n = 520, difference = -0.322, pFWER = 0.005). In contrast, mirtazapine monotherapy had greater therapeutic effects on insomnia, decreased weight and decreased appetite than nortriptyline monotherapy in Level 3 (n = 214, difference = 0.401, pFWER = 0.022). Similarly, venlafaxine with mirtazapine augmentation out-performed tranylcypromine in Level 4, especially in patients with insomnia, decreased weight and decreased appetite (n = 102, difference = -0.722, pFWER = 0.004). Finally, escitalopram with bupropion had larger therapeutic effects on increased weight, increased appetite and fatigue in CO-MED, while venlafaxine with mirtazapine had larger therapeutic effects on decreased weight, decreased appetite and insomnia (n = 640, difference = -0.302, pFWER = 0.022).\n\nInterpretationBupropion monotherapy and augmentation are effective specifically when a patient suffers from hypersomnia, increased weight, increased appetite or fatigue. Mirtazapine monotherapy and augmentation are effective in the opposite scenario, when a patient suffers from insomnia, decreased weight or decreased appetite.","date":"2025-02-05","journal":""}
{"title":"Forecasting invasive mosquito abundance in the Basque Country, Spain using machine learning techniques","doi":"10.1101\/2025.01.02.25319885","authors":"Steindorf, V.; K. B., H. M.; Stollenwerk, N.; Cevidanes, A.; Barandika, J. F.; Vazquez, P.; Garcia-Perez, A. L.; Aguiar, M.","abstract":"Mosquito-borne diseases cause millions of deaths each year and are increasingly spreading from tropical and subtropical regions into temperate zones, creating significant public health risks. The establishment of mosquito species in new areas increases the risk of local transmission (autochthonous cases), driven by both rising mosquito populations and viremic imported cases, infected travelers who can spark local transmission. Such developments present new challenges for public health systems in non-endemic regions.\n\nIn Spain, in the Basque Country region, the spread of mosquitoes, driven by changing climatic conditions, has enhanced mosquito adaptation alongside an increase in imported cases of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. By employing a model that captures the complexities of the mosquito life cycle driven by the interaction with weather variables, including temperature, precipitation, and humidity, and leveraging machine learning techniques, this study aims to predict Aedes invasive mosquito abundance in provinces of the Basque Country, using egg count as a proxy and the weather features as key independent variables.\n\nStatistical analyses explored the impact of temperature, precipitation, and humidity on mosquito egg abundance. Using lagged climate variables and ovitrap egg counts, models were evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. The Random Forest (RF) model demonstrated the highest accuracy, followed by the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMAX) model. Lastly, the best models were implemented to forecast Aedes invasive mosquito abundance in the Basque Country provinces. This forecasting tool aids vector control strategies in regions with expanding mosquito populations, highlighting the need for ongoing entomological surveillance to improve mosquito spread assessments.","date":"2025-01-02","journal":""}
{"title":"Heart rate fragmentation improves general anesthesia state classification using machine learning","doi":"10.1101\/2025.01.07.25320157","authors":"Aude, J.-C.; Fauchereau, C.; Carimalo, F.; Merienne, A.; Laffon, M.; Godat, E.","abstract":"Accurate assessment of consciousness during general anesthesia is crucial for optimizing anesthetic dosage and patient safety. Current electroencephalogram-based monitoring devices can be inaccurate or unreliable in specific surgical contexts (e.g. cephalic procedures). This study investigated the feasibility of using electrocardiogram (ECG) features and machine learning to differentiate between awake and anesthetized states. A cohort of 48 patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia at the Tours hospital was recruited. ECG-derived features were extracted, including spectral power, heart rate variability and complexity metrics, as well as heart rate fragmentation indices (HRF). These features were augmented by a range of physiological variables. The aim was to evaluate a number of machine learning algorithms in order to identify the most appropriate method for classifying the awake and anesthetized states. The gradient boosting algorithm achieved the highest accuracy (0.84). Notably, HRF metrics exhibited the strongest predictive power across all models tested. The generalizability of this ECG-based approach was further assessed using public datasets (VitalDB, Fantasia, and MIT-BIH Polysomnographic), achieving accuracies above 0.80. This study provides evidence that ECG-based classification methods can effectively distinguish awake from anesthetized states, with HRF indices playing a pivotal role in this classification.\n\nAuthor summaryGeneral anesthesia monitoring is critical for optimizing patient safety and outcomes. While electroencephalogram (EEG)-based systems are commonly used, they have limitations in accuracy and applicability, particularly in cases where EEG electrodes placement is challenging or impossible, such as during cephalic surgeries or when patients have forehead skin lesions. Here, a novel approach using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and machine learning techniques was used to differentiate between awake and anesthetized states during surgery. A total of 48 patients undergoing surgical procedures under general anaesthesia at the Tours hospital were selected for inclusion in the study. This investigation focused on heart rate fragmentation indices, metrics designed for assessing biological versus chronological age, derived from ECG recordings. The gradient boosting algorithm demonstrates performance comparable to leading methods reported in the literature for this classification task. Importantly, model generalizability was confirm through successful application to publicly available datasets. This article highlights the potential of ECG signals as an alternative source for deriving depth of anesthesia indices, offering increased versatility in clinical settings where EEG monitoring is challenging or contraindicated.","date":"2025-01-08","journal":""}

To explore the nonlinear interplay between craving and cues, this study applied dynamical systems theory (DST) to ecological momentary assessment (EMA) data. Optimized linear Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variable (SARIMAX) models were used to phenotype patients with SUD (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, opiates, and cocaine), considering the potential for complex interactions between cue exposure and craving intensity in daily life. These phenotypic profiles were replicated in computational DST models to analyze the nonlinear interactions between cues, craving, and use. The study involved 211 individuals and 8,260 observations, with 154 patients fitting the SARIMAX model for the influence of cues on craving, and 57 patients fitting the SARIMAX model for a possible influence of craving on cues. Two DST models were adjusted to replicate the complex temporal dynamics of SUD based on these two directions of influence. The first DST model (adjusted to the influence of cues on craving) showed that an increase in cues leads to a rise in craving, which then diminishes both cues and craving itself, with use patterns following cravings trajectory. This patient profile is driven by a phenomenon of \"maximum cue saturation\". The second DST model (adjusted to the influence of craving on cues) demonstrated that an increase in craving heightens cue perception, further increasing craving and leading to use, with use peaking and then reducing craving. This patient profile is characterized by a phenomenon of \"maximum use saturation\". Both models underscore craving as an essential modulator between cues and use, opening new therapeutic avenues.","date":"2025-01-15","journal":""}

A.; Mokhtar, A.","abstract":"BackgroundExploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) evaluates construct validity by identifying underlying relationships among questionnaire items, helping determine the number of latent constructs. This study aimed to validate a newly developed questionnaire on cataract surgery uptake among the community by interviewing subjects aged 50 years and older.\n\nMethodsA bilingual questionnaire, based on theoretical factors of knowledge, perception, attitude, and practice, was developed through literature review and expert interviews. It underwent forward-backward translation, content validity, and face validity assessment, followed by discussions with panels of eye care experts. Data for EFA were collected through interviews with subjects aged 50 and older, who had visual acuity worse than 6\/18 due to cataracts or had undergone cataract surgery. Responses were analyzed for factor loadings and reliability. Principal Axis Factoring (PAF) was used for factor extraction, initially based on Eigenvalues > 1, and later fixed at eight factors. Factors were rotated using Varimax with Kaiser Normalization. Items with weak factor loadings were removed iteratively, with re-analysis conducted after each removal.\n\nResultsA total of 287 subjects were recruited and consented to EFA. All 40 items in the questionnaire (knowledge, attitude, perception and practice) were combined and analysed. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test was 0.714, indicating that factor analysis was suitable for exploring the underlying structure. Bartletts test of Sphericity was highly significant (p < 0.001), indicating that the variables (questions) were sufficiently interrelated for factor analysis. Factors 3 and 7 had only two questions, although they showed fairly good loading with satisfactory correlation. The Cronbachs alpha reliability of all the factors varies from 0.50 to 0.72 (total = 0.72). The final questionnaire consisted of six factors and 22 questions.\n\nConclusionsThe developed and validated questionnaire demonstrated an acceptable factor structure related to knowledge, attitude, perception, and practice in evaluating cataract surgery uptake. This tool provides a reliable method for assessing cataract surgery uptake in the community.","date":"2025-01-31","journal":""}
