Preliminary exploration of deep learning-assisted recognition of superior labrum anterior and posterior lesions in shoulder MR arthrography.,2024-Jan,"Ming Ni, Lixiang Gao, Wen Chen, Qiang Zhao, Yuqing Zhao, Chenyu Jiang, Huishu Yuan","MR arthrography (MRA) is the most accurate method for preoperatively diagnosing superior labrum anterior-posterior (SLAP) lesions, but diagnostic results can vary considerably due to factors such as experience. In this study, deep learning was used to facilitate the preliminary identification of SLAP lesions and compared with radiologists of different seniority."
Wearable Inertial Sensors for Daily Activity Analysis Based on Adam Optimization and the Maximum Entropy Markov Model.,2020-May-20,"Sheikh Badar Ud Din Tahir, Ahmad Jalal, Kibum Kim","Advancements in wearable sensors technologies provide prominent effects in the daily life activities of humans. These wearable sensors are gaining more awareness in healthcare for the elderly to ensure their independent living and to improve their comfort. In this paper, we present a human activity recognition model that acquires signal data from motion node sensors including inertial sensors, i.e., gyroscopes and accelerometers. First, the inertial data is processed via multiple filters such as Savitzky-Golay, median and hampel filters to examine lower/upper cutoff frequency behaviors. Second, it extracts a multifused model for statistical, wavelet and binary features to maximize the occurrence of optimal feature values. Then, adaptive moment estimation (Adam) and AdaDelta are introduced in a feature optimization phase to adopt learning rate patterns. These optimized patterns are further processed by the maximum entropy Markov model (MEMM) for empirical expectation and highest entropy, which measure signal variances for outperformed accuracy results. Our model was experimentally evaluated on University of Southern California Human Activity Dataset (USC-HAD) as a benchmark dataset and on an Intelligent Mediasporting behavior (IMSB), which is a new self-annotated sports dataset. For evaluation, we used the ""leave-one-out"" cross validation scheme and the results outperformed existing well-known statistical state-of-the-art methods by achieving an improved recognition accuracy of 91.25%, 93.66% and 90.91% when compared with USC-HAD, IMSB, and Mhealth datasets, respectively. The proposed system should be applicable to man-machine interface domains, such as health exercises, robot learning, interactive games and pattern-based surveillance."
Differential gene regulatory pattern in the human brain from schizophrenia using transcriptomic-causal network.,2020-Oct-21,"Akram Yazdani, Raul Mendez-Giraldez, Azam Yazdani, Michael R Kosorok, Panos Roussos","Common and complex traits are the consequence of the interaction and regulation of multiple genes simultaneously, therefore characterizing the interconnectivity of genes is essential to unravel the underlying biological networks. However, the focus of many studies is on the differential expression of individual genes or on co-expression analysis."

Understandable learning machine system design for transmembrane or embedded membrane segments prediction.,2011,"Hae-Jin Hu, Robert W Harrison, Phang C Tai, Yi Pan",We modified an existing association rule-based classifier CPAR to improve traditional black box model based learning machine approaches on Transmembrane (TM) segment prediction. The modified classifier was improved further by combining with SVM. The experimental results indicate that this hybrid scheme offers biologically meaningful rules on TM/EM segment prediction while maintaining the performance almost as well as the SVM method. The evaluation of the sturdiness and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis proved that this new scheme is robust and competent with SVM on TM/EM segment prediction.

"Protein complexes, big data, machine learning and integrative proteomics: lessons learned over a decade of systematic analysis of protein interaction networks.",2017-Oct,"Pierre C Havugimana, Pingzhao Hu, Andrew Emili","Elucidation of the networks of physical (functional) interactions present in cells and tissues is fundamental for understanding the molecular organization of biological systems, the mechanistic basis of essential and disease-related processes, and for functional annotation of previously uncharacterized proteins (via guilt-by-association or -correlation). After a decade in the field, we felt it timely to document our own experiences in the systematic analysis of protein interaction networks. Areas covered: Researchers worldwide have contributed innovative experimental and computational approaches that have driven the rapidly evolving field of 'functional proteomics'. These include mass spectrometry-based methods to characterize macromolecular complexes on a global-scale and sophisticated data analysis tools - most notably machine learning - that allow for the generation of high-quality protein association maps. Expert commentary: Here, we recount some key lessons learned, with an emphasis on successful workflows, and challenges, arising from our own and other groups' ongoing efforts to generate, interpret and report proteome-scale interaction networks in increasingly diverse biological contexts."
A spheroid whole mount drug testing pipeline with machine-learning based image analysis identifies cell-type specific differences in drug efficacy on a single-cell level.,2024-Dec-18,"Mario Vitacolonna, Roman Bruch, Richard Schneider, Julia Jabs, Mathias Hafner, Markus Reischl, Rüdiger Rudolf","The growth and drug response of tumors are influenced by their stromal composition, both in vivo and 3D-cell culture models. Cell-type inherent features as well as mutual relationships between the different cell types in a tumor might affect drug susceptibility of the tumor as a whole and/or of its cell populations. However, a lack of single-cell procedures with sufficient detail has hampered the automated observation of cell-type-specific effects in three-dimensional stroma-tumor cell co-cultures."

Consensus based framework for digital mobility monitoring.,2021,"Felix Kluge, Silvia Del Din, Andrea Cereatti, Heiko Gaßner, Clint Hansen, Jorunn L Helbostad, Jochen Klucken, Arne Küderle, Arne Müller, Lynn Rochester, Martin Ullrich, Bjoern M Eskofier, Claudia Mazzà","Digital mobility assessment using wearable sensor systems has the potential to capture walking performance in a patient's natural environment. It enables monitoring of health status and disease progression and evaluation of interventions in real-world situations. In contrast to laboratory settings, real-world walking occurs in non-conventional environments and under unconstrained and uncontrolled conditions. Despite the general understanding, there is a lack of agreed definitions about what constitutes real-world walking, impeding the comparison and interpretation of the acquired data across systems and studies. The goal of this study was to obtain expert-based consensus on specific aspects of real-world walking and to provide respective definitions in a common terminological framework. An adapted Delphi method was used to obtain agreed definitions related to real-world walking. In an online survey, 162 participants from a panel of academic, clinical and industrial experts with experience in the field of gait analysis were asked for agreement on previously specified definitions. Descriptive statistics was used to evaluate whether consent (> 75% agreement as defined a priori) was reached. Of 162 experts invited to participate, 51 completed all rounds (31.5% response rate). We obtained consensus on all definitions (""Walking"" > 90%, ""Purposeful"" > 75%, ""Real-world"" > 90%, ""Walking bout"" > 80%, ""Walking speed"" > 75%, ""Turning"" > 90% agreement) after two rounds. The identification of a consented set of real-world walking definitions has important implications for the development of assessment and analysis protocols, as well as for the reporting and comparison of digital mobility outcomes across studies and systems. The definitions will serve as a common framework for implementing digital and mobile technologies for gait assessment and are an important link for the transition from supervised to unsupervised gait assessment."

Identifying influential factors using machine learning techniques on the intention to receive a COVID-19 booster dose and vaccine fatigue among partially vaccinated individuals.,2024,"Athina Bikaki, Justin M Luningham, Erika L Thompson, Brittany Krenek, Jamboor K Vishwanatha, Ioannis A Kakadiaris","This study assesses COVID-19 booster intentions and hesitancy in Texas, a state known for its diversity and libertarian values. A survey was conducted with 274 participants residing in Texas between June and July 2022. The analysis examined sociodemographic and health-related factors, trusted information sources, and preventive behaviors. The survey focused on vaccinated participants and their intention to receive the booster dose, which was categorized into three outcomes: yes, no, and not sure. Machine learning techniques were employed to analyze the survey responses of vaccinated participants to identify the most critical factors. Among the participants, 113 expressed their intention to get the booster (41.2%), 107 did not plan to receive the booster (39.1%), and 54 remained undecided (19.7%). Our findings indicate that the perception of vaccine safety significantly influenced the decision to receive the booster dose. Those who reported trust in social media contacts as reliable information sources were more likely to intend to boost. Additionally, among those hospitalized when diagnosed with COVID-19, the largest proportion were unwilling to receive the booster (47.0%) compared to those who intended to receive the booster (33.3%). In contrast, most of those who believed they would be hospitalized if infected with COVID-19 intended to get the booster. Other factors did not demonstrate a significant association. Our findings are highly transferable and can offer valuable insights, particularly for countries where COVID-19 remains prevalent and are pivotal both presently and in the future for developing strategies to improve booster uptake and shape public health initiatives in epidemic and pandemic outbreaks."
A survey of recently emerged genome-wide computational enhancer predictor tools.,2018-Jun,"Leonard Whye Kit Lim, Hung Hui Chung, Yee Ling Chong, Nung Kion Lee","The race for the discovery of enhancers at a genome-wide scale has been on since the commencement of next generation sequencing decades after the discovery of the first enhancer, SV40. A few enhancer-predicting features such as chromatin feature, histone modifications and sequence feature had been implemented with varying success rates. However, to date, there is no consensus yet on the single enhancer marker that can be employed to ultimately distinguish and uncover enhancers from the enormous genomic regions. Many supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised computational approaches had emerged to complement and facilitate experimental approaches in enhancer discovery. In this review, we placed our focus on the recently emerged enhancer predictor tools that work on general enhancer features such as sequences, chromatin states and histone modifications, eRNA and of multiple feature approach. Comparisons of their prediction methods and outcomes were done across their functionally similar counterparts. We provide some recommendations and insights for future development of more comprehensive and robust tools."
Tailored point-of-care biosensors for liquid biopsy in the field of oncology.,2022-Dec-20,"Sima Singh, Pritam Saha Podder, Matt Russo, Charles Henry, Stefano Cinti","In the field of cancer detection, technologies to analyze tumors using biomarkers circulating in fluids such as blood have developed rapidly based on liquid biopsy. A proactive approach to early cancer detection can lead to more effective treatments with minimal side effects and better long-term patient survival. However, early detection of cancer is hindered by the existing limitations of conventional cancer diagnostic methods. To enable early diagnosis and regular monitoring and improve automation, the development of integrated point-of-care (POC) and biosensors is needed. This is expected to fundamentally change the diagnosis, management, and monitoring of response to treatment of cancer. POC-based techniques will provide a way to avoid complications that occur after invasive tissue biopsy, such as bleeding, infection, and pain. The aim of this study is to provide a comprehensive view of biosensors and their clinical relevance in oncology for the detection of biomarkers with liquid biopsies of proteins, miRNA, ctDNA, exosomes, and cancer cells. The preceding discussion also illustrates the changing landscape of liquid biopsy-based cancer diagnosis through nanomaterials, machine learning, artificial intelligence, wearable devices, and sensors, many of which apply POC design principles. With the advent of sensitive, selective, and timely detection of cancer, we see the field of POC technology for cancer detection and treatment undergoing a positive paradigm shift in the foreseeable future."
Application of visible and near infrared hyperspectral imaging for non-invasively measuring distribution of water-holding capacity in salmon flesh.,2013-Nov-15,"Di Wu, Da-Wen Sun","Water-holding capacity (WHC) is a primary quality determinant of salmon flesh. One of the limiting factors for not having a direct measurement of WHC for salmon quality grading is that current WHC measurements are destructive, time-consuming, and inefficient. In this study, two hyperspectral image systems operated in the visible and short-wave near infrared range (400-1000 nm) and the long-wave near infrared range (897-1753 nm) were applied for non-invasive determination of four WHC indices, namely percentage liquid loss (PLL), percentage water loss (PWL), percentage fat loss (PFL), and percentage water remained (PWR) of salmon flesh. Two calibration methods of partial least square regression (PLSR) and least-squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) were applied, respectively, to establish calibration models of WHC indices based on the spectral signatures of salmon flesh, and the performances of these two methods were compared to determine the optimal spectral calibration strategy. The performances were also compared between two hyperspectral image systems, when full range spectra were considered. Out of 121 wavelength variables, only thirteen (PLL), twelve (PWL), nine (PFL), and twelve variables (PWR) were selected as important variables by using competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) algorithm to reduce redundancy and collinearity of hyperspectral images. The CARS-PLSR combination was identified as the optimal method to calibrate the prediction models for WHC determination, resulting in good correlation coefficient of prediction (rP) of 0.941, 0.937, 0.815, and 0.970 for PLL, PWL, PFL, and PWR analysis, respectively. CARS-PLSR equations were obtained according to the regression coefficients of the CARS-PLSR models and were transferred to each pixel in the image for visualizing WHC indices in all portions of the salmon fillet. The overall results show that the laborious, time-consuming, and destructive traditional techniques could be replaced by hyperspectral imaging to provide a rapid and non-invasive measurement of WHC distribution in salmon flesh."

Unsupervised learning of spatially-resolved ARPES spectra for epitaxially grown graphene via non-negative matrix factorization.,2024-Oct-15,"Masaki Imamura, Kazutoshi Takahashi","This study proposed an unsupervised machine-learning approach for analyzing spatially-resolved ARPES. A combination of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and k-means clustering was applied to spatially-resolved ARPES spectra of the graphene epitaxially grown on a SiC substrate. The Dirac cones of graphene were decomposed and reproduced fairly well using NMF. The base and activation matrices obtained from the NMF results reflected the detailed spectral features derived from the number of graphene layers and growth directions. The spatial distribution of graphene thickness on the substrate was clearly visualized by the clustering using the activation matrices acquired via NMF. Integration with k-means clustering enables clear visualization of spatial variations. Our method efficiently handles large datasets, extracting spectral features without manual inspection. It offers broad applicability beyond graphene studies to analyze ARPES spectra in various materials."
Dependency-based Siamese long short-term memory network for learning sentence representations.,2018,"Wenhao Zhu, Tengjun Yao, Jianyue Ni, Baogang Wei, Zhiguo Lu","Textual representations play an important role in the field of natural language processing (NLP). The efficiency of NLP tasks, such as text comprehension and information extraction, can be significantly improved with proper textual representations. As neural networks are gradually applied to learn the representation of words and phrases, fairly efficient models of learning short text representations have been developed, such as the continuous bag of words (CBOW) and skip-gram models, and they have been extensively employed in a variety of NLP tasks. Because of the complex structure generated by the longer text lengths, such as sentences, algorithms appropriate for learning short textual representations are not applicable for learning long textual representations. One method of learning long textual representations is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is suitable for processing sequences. However, the standard LSTM does not adequately address the primary sentence structure (subject, predicate and object), which is an important factor for producing appropriate sentence representations. To resolve this issue, this paper proposes the dependency-based LSTM model (D-LSTM). The D-LSTM divides a sentence representation into two parts: a basic component and a supporting component. The D-LSTM uses a pre-trained dependency parser to obtain the primary sentence information and generate supporting components, and it also uses a standard LSTM model to generate the basic sentence components. A weight factor that can adjust the ratio of the basic and supporting components in a sentence is introduced to generate the sentence representation. Compared with the representation learned by the standard LSTM, the sentence representation learned by the D-LSTM contains a greater amount of useful information. The experimental results show that the D-LSTM is superior to the standard LSTM for sentences involving compositional knowledge (SICK) data."

Analysis and prediction of COVID-19 trajectory: A machine learning approach.,2021-Nov,"Ritanjali Majhi, Rahul Thangeda, Renu Prasad Sugasi, Niraj Kumar","The outbreak of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted everyday lives globally. The number of positive cases is growing and India is now one of the most affected countries. This paper builds predictive models that can predict the number of positive cases with higher accuracy. Regression-based, Decision tree-based, and Random forest-based models have been built on the data from China and are validated on India's sample. The model is found to be effective and will be able to predict the positive number of cases in the future with minimal error. The developed machine learning model can work in real-time and can effectively predict the number of positive cases. Key measures and suggestions have been put forward considering the effect of lockdown."
Development of a Mouse Pain Scale Using Sub-second Behavioral Mapping and Statistical Modeling.,2019-Aug-06,"Ishmail Abdus-Saboor, Nathan T Fried, Mark Lay, Justin Burdge, Kathryn Swanson, Roman Fischer, Jessica Jones, Peter Dong, Weihua Cai, Xinying Guo, Yuan-Xiang Tao, John Bethea, Minghong Ma, Xinzhong Dong, Long Ding, Wenqin Luo","Rodents are the main model systems for pain research, but determining their pain state is challenging. To develop an objective method to assess pain sensation in mice, we adopt high-speed videography to capture sub-second behavioral features following hind paw stimulation with both noxious and innocuous stimuli and identify several differentiating parameters indicating the affective and reflexive aspects of nociception. Using statistical modeling and machine learning, we integrate these parameters into a single index and create a ""mouse pain scale,"" which allows us to assess pain sensation in a graded manner for each withdrawal. We demonstrate the utility of this method by determining sensations triggered by three different von Frey hairs and optogenetic activation of two different nociceptor populations. Our behavior-based ""pain scale"" approach will help improve the rigor and reproducibility of using withdrawal reflex assays to assess pain sensation in mice."
Suppressing Electron Exposure Artifacts: An Electron Scanning Paradigm with Bayesian Machine Learning.,2016-Aug,"Karl Hujsak, Benjamin D Myers, Eric Roth, Yue Li, Vinayak P Dravid","Electron microscopy of biological, polymeric, and other beam-sensitive structures is often hampered by deleterious electron beam interactions. In fact, imaging of such beam-sensitive materials is limited by the allowable radiation dosage rather that capabilities of the microscope itself, which has been compounded by the availability of high brightness electron sources. Reducing dwell times to overcome dose-related artifacts, such as radiolysis and electrostatic charging, is challenging due to the inherently low contrast in imaging of many such materials. These challenges are particularly exacerbated during dynamic time-resolved, fluidic cell imaging, or three-dimensional tomographic reconstruction-all of which undergo additional dosage. Thus, there is a pressing need for the development of techniques to produce high-quality images at ever lower electron doses. In this contribution, we demonstrate direct dose reduction and suppression of beam-induced artifacts through under-sampling pixels, by as much as 80% reduction in dosage, using a commercial scanning electron microscope with an electrostatic beam blanker and a dictionary learning in-painting algorithm. This allows for multiple sparse recoverable images to be acquired at the cost of one fully sampled image. We believe this approach may open new ways to conduct imaging, which otherwise require compromising beam current and/or exposure conditions."
Movement recognition technology as a method of assessing spontaneous general movements in high risk infants.,2014,"Claire Marcroft, Aftab Khan, Nicholas D Embleton, Michael Trenell, Thomas Plötz","Preterm birth is associated with increased risks of neurological and motor impairments such as cerebral palsy. The risks are highest in those born at the lowest gestations. Early identification of those most at risk is challenging meaning that a critical window of opportunity to improve outcomes through therapy-based interventions may be missed. Clinically, the assessment of spontaneous general movements is an important tool, which can be used for the prediction of movement impairments in high risk infants. Movement recognition aims to capture and analyze relevant limb movements through computerized approaches focusing on continuous, objective, and quantitative assessment. Different methods of recording and analyzing infant movements have recently been explored in high risk infants. These range from camera-based solutions to body-worn miniaturized movement sensors used to record continuous time-series data that represent the dynamics of limb movements. Various machine learning methods have been developed and applied to the analysis of the recorded movement data. This analysis has focused on the detection and classification of atypical spontaneous general movements. This article aims to identify recent translational studies using movement recognition technology as a method of assessing movement in high risk infants. The application of this technology within pediatric practice represents a growing area of inter-disciplinary collaboration, which may lead to a greater understanding of the development of the nervous system in infants at high risk of motor impairment."

AuthorSynth: a collaboration network and behaviorally-based visualization tool of activation reports from the neuroscience literature.,2015,Vanessa V Sochat,"Targeted collaboration is becoming more challenging with the ever-increasing number of publications, conferences, and academic responsibilities that the modern-day researcher must synthesize. Specifically, the field of neuroimaging had roughly 10,000 new papers in PubMed for the year 2013, presenting tens of thousands of international authors, each a potential collaborator working on some sub-domain in the field. To remove the burden of synthesizing an entire corpus of publications, talks, and conference interactions to find and assess collaborations, we combine meta-analytical neuroimaging informatics methods with machine learning and network analysis toward this goal. We present ""AuthorSynth,"" a novel application prototype that includes (1) a collaboration network to identify researchers with similar results reported in the literature; and (2) a 2D plot-""brain lattice""-to visually summarize a single author's contribution to the field, and allow for searching of authors based on behavioral terms. This method capitalizes on intelligent synthesis of the neuroimaging literature, and demonstrates that data-driven approaches can be used to confirm existing collaborations, reveal potential ones, and identify gaps in published knowledge. We believe this tool exemplifies how methods from neuroimaging informatics can better inform researchers about progress and knowledge in the field, and enhance the modern workflow of finding collaborations."

EASE-MM: Sequence-Based Prediction of Mutation-Induced Stability Changes with Feature-Based Multiple Models.,2016-Mar-27,"Lukas Folkman, Bela Stantic, Abdul Sattar, Yaoqi Zhou","Protein engineering and characterisation of non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) require accurate prediction of protein stability changes (ΔΔGu) induced by single amino acid substitutions. Here, we have developed a new prediction method called Evolutionary, Amino acid, and Structural Encodings with Multiple Models (EASE-MM), which comprises five specialised support vector machine (SVM) models and makes the final prediction from a consensus of two models selected based on the predicted secondary structure and accessible surface area of the mutated residue. The new method is applicable to single-domain monomeric proteins and can predict ΔΔGu with a protein sequence and mutation as the only inputs. EASE-MM yielded a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.53-0.59 in 10-fold cross-validation and independent testing and was able to outperform other sequence-based methods. When compared to structure-based energy functions, EASE-MM achieved a comparable or better performance. The application to a large dataset of human germline non-synonymous SNVs showed that the disease-causing variants tend to be associated with larger magnitudes of ΔΔGu predicted with EASE-MM. The EASE-MM web-server is available at http://sparks-lab.org/server/ease."
The Hierarchical Continuous Pursuit Learning Automation: A Novel Scheme for Environments With Large Numbers of Actions.,2020-Feb,"Anis Yazidi, Xuan Zhang, Lei Jiao, B John Oommen","Although the field of learning automata (LA) has made significant progress in the past four decades, the LA-based methods to tackle problems involving environments with a large number of actions is, in reality, relatively unresolved. The extension of the traditional LA to problems within this domain cannot be easily established when the number of actions is very large. This is because the dimensionality of the action probability vector is correspondingly large, and so, most components of the vector will soon have values that are smaller than the machine accuracy permits, implying that they will never be chosen. This paper presents a solution that extends the continuous pursuit paradigm to such large-actioned problem domains. The beauty of the solution is that it is hierarchical, where all the actions offered by the environment reside as leaves of the hierarchy. Furthermore, at every level, we merely require a two-action LA that automatically resolves the problem of dealing with arbitrarily small action probabilities. In addition, since all the LA invoke the pursuit paradigm, the best action at every level trickles up toward the root. Thus, by invoking the property of the ""max"" operator, in which the maximum of numerous maxima is the overall maximum, the hierarchy of LA converges to the optimal action. This paper describes the scheme and formally proves its ϵ -optimal convergence. The results presented here can, rather trivially, be extended for the families of discretized and Bayesian pursuit LA too. This paper also reports extensive experimental results (including for environments having 128 and 256 actions) that demonstrate the power of the scheme and its computational advantages. As far as we know, there are no comparable pursuit-based results in the field of LA. In some cases, the hierarchical continuous pursuit automaton requires less than 18% of the number of iterations than the benchmark L"

Transfer learning improves supervised image segmentation across imaging protocols.,2015-May,"Annegreet van Opbroek, M Arfan Ikram, Meike W Vernooij, Marleen de Bruijne","The variation between images obtained with different scanners or different imaging protocols presents a major challenge in automatic segmentation of biomedical images. This variation especially hampers the application of otherwise successful supervised-learning techniques which, in order to perform well, often require a large amount of labeled training data that is exactly representative of the target data. We therefore propose to use transfer learning for image segmentation. Transfer-learning techniques can cope with differences in distributions between training and target data, and therefore may improve performance over supervised learning for segmentation across scanners and scan protocols. We present four transfer classifiers that can train a classification scheme with only a small amount of representative training data, in addition to a larger amount of other training data with slightly different characteristics. The performance of the four transfer classifiers was compared to that of standard supervised classification on two magnetic resonance imaging brain-segmentation tasks with multi-site data: white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid segmentation; and white-matter-/MS-lesion segmentation. The experiments showed that when there is only a small amount of representative training data available, transfer learning can greatly outperform common supervised-learning approaches, minimizing classification errors by up to 60%."

Understanding what makes them immune could inform public health policies as to who needs to be protected and why, and possibly lead to a novel treatment for those who cannot, or will not, be vaccinated once a vaccine is available."
Integrated ensemble CNN and explainable AI for COVID-19 diagnosis from CT scan and X-ray images.,2024-Oct-23,"Reenu Rajpoot, Mahesh Gour, Sweta Jain, Vijay Bhaskar Semwal","In light of the ongoing battle against COVID-19, while the pandemic may eventually subside, sporadic cases may still emerge, underscoring the need for accurate detection from radiological images. However, the limited explainability of current deep learning models restricts clinician acceptance. To address this issue, our research integrates multiple CNN models with explainable AI techniques, ensuring model interpretability before ensemble construction. Our approach enhances both accuracy and interpretability by evaluating advanced CNN models on the largest publicly available X-ray dataset, COVIDx CXR-3, which includes 29,986 images, and the CT scan dataset for SARS-CoV-2 from Kaggle, which includes a total of 2,482 images. We also employed additional public datasets for cross-dataset evaluation, ensuring a thorough assessment of model performance across various imaging conditions. By leveraging methods including LIME, SHAP, Grad-CAM, and Grad-CAM++, we provide transparent insights into model decisions. Our ensemble model, which includes DenseNet169, ResNet50, and VGG16, demonstrates strong performance. For the X-ray image dataset, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1-score, and AUC are recorded at 99.00%, 99.00%, 99.00%, 0.99, and 0.99, respectively. For the CT image dataset, these metrics are 96.18%, 96.18%, 96.18%, 0.9618, and 0.96, respectively. Our methodology bridges the gap between precision and interpretability in clinical settings by combining model diversity with explainability, promising enhanced disease diagnosis and greater clinician acceptance."

Consequently, many automated segmentation methods have been developed."
Predictive Value of Machine Learning Models for Cerebral Edema Risk in Stroke Patients: A Meta-Analysis.,2025-Jan,"Qi Deng, Yu Yang, Hongyu Bai, Fei Li, Wenluo Zhang, Rong He, Yuming Li","Stroke patients are at high risk of developing cerebral edema, which can have severe consequences. However, there are currently few effective tools for early identification or prediction of this risk. As machine learning (ML) is increasingly used in clinical practice, its effectiveness in predicting cerebral edema risk in stroke patients has been explored. Nonetheless, the lack of systematic evidence on its predictive value challenges the update of simple and user-friendly risk assessment tools. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the predictive utility of ML for cerebral edema in stroke patients."
Machine learning-augmented objective functional testing in the degenerative spine: quantifying impairment using patient-specific five-repetition sit-to-stand assessment.,2021-Nov,"Victor E Staartjes, Anita M Klukowska, Moira Vieli, Christiaan H B van Niftrik, Martin N Stienen, Carlo Serra, Luca Regli, W Peter Vandertop, Marc L Schröder","What is considered ""abnormal"" in clinical testing is typically defined by simple thresholds derived from normative data. For instance, when testing using the five-repetition sit-to-stand (5R-STS) test, the upper limit of normal (ULN) from a population of spine-healthy volunteers (10.5 seconds) is used to identify objective functional impairment (OFI), but this fails to consider different properties of individuals (e.g., taller and shorter, older and younger). Therefore, the authors developed a personalized testing strategy to quantify patient-specific OFI using machine learning."
"Identifying disease genes using machine learning and gene functional similarities, assessed through Gene Ontology.",2018,"Muhammad Asif, Hugo F M C M Martiniano, Astrid M Vicente, Francisco M Couto","Identifying disease genes from a vast amount of genetic data is one of the most challenging tasks in the post-genomic era. Also, complex diseases present highly heterogeneous genotype, which difficult biological marker identification. Machine learning methods are widely used to identify these markers, but their performance is highly dependent upon the size and quality of available data. In this study, we demonstrated that machine learning classifiers trained on gene functional similarities, using Gene Ontology (GO), can improve the identification of genes involved in complex diseases. For this purpose, we developed a supervised machine learning methodology to predict complex disease genes. The proposed pipeline was assessed using Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) candidate genes. A quantitative measure of gene functional similarities was obtained by employing different semantic similarity measures. To infer the hidden functional similarities between ASD genes, various types of machine learning classifiers were built on quantitative semantic similarity matrices of ASD and non-ASD genes. The classifiers trained and tested on ASD and non-ASD gene functional similarities outperformed previously reported ASD classifiers. For example, a Random Forest (RF) classifier achieved an AUC of 0. 80 for predicting new ASD genes, which was higher than the reported classifier (0.73). Additionally, this classifier was able to predict 73 novel ASD candidate genes that were enriched for core ASD phenotypes, such as autism and obsessive-compulsive behavior. In addition, predicted genes were also enriched for ASD co-occurring conditions, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). We also developed a KNIME workflow with the proposed methodology which allows users to configure and execute it without requiring machine learning and programming skills. Machine learning is an effective and reliable technique to decipher ASD mechanism by identifying novel disease genes, but this study further demonstrated that their performance can be improved by incorporating a quantitative measure of gene functional similarities. Source code and the workflow of the proposed methodology are available at https://github.com/Muh-Asif/ASD-genes-prediction."
Bayesian Self-Optimization for Telescoped Continuous Flow Synthesis.,2023-Jan-16,"Adam D Clayton, Edward O Pyzer-Knapp, Mark Purdie, Martin F Jones, Alexandre Barthelme, John Pavey, Nikil Kapur, Thomas W Chamberlain, A John Blacker, Richard A Bourne","The optimization of multistep chemical syntheses is critical for the rapid development of new pharmaceuticals. However, concatenating individually optimized reactions can lead to inefficient multistep syntheses, owing to chemical interdependencies between the steps. Herein, we develop an automated continuous flow platform for the simultaneous optimization of telescoped reactions. Our approach is applied to a Heck cyclization-deprotection reaction sequence, used in the synthesis of a precursor for 1-methyltetrahydroisoquinoline C5 functionalization. A simple method for multipoint sampling with a single online HPLC instrument was designed, enabling accurate quantification of each reaction, and an in-depth understanding of the reaction pathways. Notably, integration of Bayesian optimization techniques identified an 81 % overall yield in just 14 h, and revealed a favorable competing pathway for formation of the desired product."

Physics-informed machine learning and its structural integrity applications: state of the art.,2023-Nov-13,"Shun-Peng Zhu, Lanyi Wang, Changqi Luo, José A F O Correia, Abílio M P De Jesus, Filippo Berto, Qingyuan Y Wang","The development of machine learning (ML) provides a promising solution to guarantee the structural integrity of critical components during service period. However, considering the lack of respect for the underlying physical laws, the data hungry nature and poor extrapolation performance, the further application of pure data-driven methods in structural integrity is challenged. An emerging ML paradigm, physics-informed machine learning (PIML), attempts to overcome these limitations by embedding physical information into ML models. This paper discusses different ways of embedding physical information into ML and reviews the developments of PIML in structural integrity including failure mechanism modelling and prognostic and health management (PHM). The exploration of the application of PIML to structural integrity demonstrates the potential of PIML for improving consistency with prior knowledge, extrapolation performance, prediction accuracy, interpretability and computational efficiency and reducing dependence on training data. The analysis and findings of this work outline the limitations at this stage and provide some potential research direction of PIML to develop advanced PIML for ensuring structural integrity of engineering systems/facilities. This article is part of the theme issue 'Physics-informed machine learning and its structural integrity applications (Part 1)'."
GAHLS: an optimized graph analytics based high level synthesis framework.,2023-Dec-19,"Yao Xiao, Shahin Nazarian, Paul Bogdan","The urgent need for low latency, high-compute and low power on-board intelligence in autonomous systems, cyber-physical systems, robotics, edge computing, evolvable computing, and complex data science calls for determining the optimal amount and type of specialized hardware together with reconfigurability capabilities. With these goals in mind, we propose a novel comprehensive graph analytics based high level synthesis (GAHLS) framework that efficiently analyzes complex high level programs through a combined compiler-based approach and graph theoretic optimization and synthesizes them into message passing domain-specific accelerators. This GAHLS framework first constructs a compiler-assisted dependency graph (CaDG) from low level virtual machine (LLVM) intermediate representation (IR) of high level programs and converts it into a hardware friendly description representation. Next, the GAHLS framework performs a memory design space exploration while account for the identified computational properties from the CaDG and optimizing the system performance for higher bandwidth. The GAHLS framework also performs a robust optimization to identify the CaDG subgraphs with similar computational structures and aggregate them into intelligent processing clusters in order to optimize the usage of underlying hardware resources. Finally, the GAHLS framework synthesizes this compressed specialized CaDG into processing elements while optimizing the system performance and area metrics. Evaluations of the GAHLS framework on several real-life applications (e.g., deep learning, brain machine interfaces) demonstrate that it provides 14.27× performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art approaches such as LegUp 6.2."
A shot taxonomy in the era of tracking data in professional tennis.,2018-Sep,"Stephanie Kovalchik, Machar Reid","Shots are an essential part of the language of tennis yet little is known about the distinct types of shots in the professional game. In this study, we build a taxonomy of shots for elite tennis players using tracking data from multiple years of men's and women's matches at the Australian Open. Our taxonomy is constructed using model-based multi-stage functional data clustering, an unsupervised machine learning approach. Among 270,023 men's and 178,136 women's shots, we found 13 distinct types of serves to both the Ad and Deuce court for male players and 17 and 15 types to the Ad and Deuce for female players. More variety was found among serve returns and rally shots compared to the serve; with less variety on the backhand than forehand. There was also more overlap in the physical characteristics of groundstroke shots between male and female players than on serve. Shot type was strongly associated with winning points and shots in the highest speed and lowest net clearance categories tended to be the most effective. This data-driven dictionary of shots provides a framework for analysis of elite player performance, characterizing playing style, and designing more representative practice."

The Impact of Pretrained Language Models on Negation and Speculation Detection in Cross-Lingual Medical Text: Comparative Study.,2020-Dec-03,"Renzo Rivera Zavala, Paloma Martinez","Negation and speculation are critical elements in natural language processing (NLP)-related tasks, such as information extraction, as these phenomena change the truth value of a proposition. In the clinical narrative that is informal, these linguistic facts are used extensively with the objective of indicating hypotheses, impressions, or negative findings. Previous state-of-the-art approaches addressed negation and speculation detection tasks using rule-based methods, but in the last few years, models based on machine learning and deep learning exploiting morphological, syntactic, and semantic features represented as spare and dense vectors have emerged. However, although such methods of named entity recognition (NER) employ a broad set of features, they are limited to existing pretrained models for a specific domain or language."
Research on hybrid intrusion detection method based on the ADASYN and ID3 algorithms.,2022-Jan,"Yue Li, Wusheng Xu, Wei Li, Ang Li, Zengjin Liu","Intrusion detection system plays an important role in network security. Early detection of the potential attacks can prevent the further network intrusion from adversaries. To improve the effectiveness of the intrusion detection rate, this paper proposes a hybrid intrusion detection method that utilizes ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic) and the decision tree based on ID3 algorithm. At first, the intrusion detection dataset is transformed by coding technology and normalized. Subsequently, the ADASYN algorithm is applied to implement oversampling on the training set, and the ID3 algorithm is employed to build a decision tree model. In addition, the model proposed by the research is evaluated by accuracy, precision, recall, and false alarm rate. Besides, a performance comparison is conducted with other models. Consequently, it is found that the combined model based on ADASYN and ID3 decision tree proposed in this research possesses higher accuracy as well as lower false alarm rate, which is more suitable for intrusion detection tasks."
Modeling the adsorption of PAH mixture in silica nanopores by molecular dynamic simulation combined with machine learning.,2016-Feb,"Hong Sui, Lin Li, Xinzhe Zhu, Daoyi Chen, Guozhong Wu","The persistence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in contaminated soils is largely controlled by their molecular fate in soil pores. The adsorption and diffusion of 16 PAHs mixture in silica nanopore with diameter of 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 and 3.5 nm, respectively, were characterized by adsorption energy, mean square displacement, free surface area and free volume fraction using molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. Results suggested that PAHs adsorption in silica nanopores was associated with diffusion process while competitive sorption was not the dominant mechanism in context of this study. The partial least squares (PLS) regression and machine learning (ML) methods (i.e. support vector regression, M5 decision tree and multilayer perceptrons) were used to correlate the adsorption energy with the pore diameter and PAH properties (number of carbon atoms, aromatic ring number, boiling point, molecular weight, octanol-water partition coefficient, octanol-organic carbon partition coefficient, solvent accessible area, solvent accessible volume and polarization). Results indicated that the PAH adsorption could not be predicted by linear regression as the R(2)Y and Q(2)Y coefficients of PLS analysis was 0.375 and 0.199, respectively. The nonlinearity was well recognized by ML with correlation coefficient up to 0.9. Overall, the combination of MD simulation and ML approaches can assist in interpreting the sequestration of organic contaminants in the soil nanopores."
Current Trends of Raman Spectroscopy in Clinic Settings: Opportunities and Challenges.,2024-Feb,"Yumei Wang, Liuru Fang, Yuhua Wang, Zuzhao Xiong","Early clinical diagnosis, effective intraoperative guidance, and an accurate prognosis can lead to timely and effective medical treatment. The current conventional clinical methods have several limitations. Therefore, there is a need to develop faster and more reliable clinical detection, treatment, and monitoring methods to enhance their clinical applications. Raman spectroscopy is noninvasive and provides highly specific information about the molecular structure and biochemical composition of analytes in a rapid and accurate manner. It has a wide range of applications in biomedicine, materials, and clinical settings. This review primarily focuses on the application of Raman spectroscopy in clinical medicine. The advantages and limitations of Raman spectroscopy over traditional clinical methods are discussed. In addition, the advantages of combining Raman spectroscopy with machine learning, nanoparticles, and probes are demonstrated, thereby extending its applicability to different clinical phases. Examples of the clinical applications of Raman spectroscopy over the last 3 years are also integrated. Finally, various prospective approaches based on Raman spectroscopy in clinical studies are surveyed, and current challenges are discussed."
Low-Dose CT Image Denoising Using a Generative Adversarial Network With Wasserstein Distance and Perceptual Loss.,2018-Jun,"Qingsong Yang, Pingkun Yan, Yanbo Zhang, Hengyong Yu, Yongyi Shi, Xuanqin Mou, Mannudeep K Kalra, Yi Zhang, Ling Sun, Ge Wang","The continuous development and extensive use of computed tomography (CT) in medical practice has raised a public concern over the associated radiation dose to the patient. Reducing the radiation dose may lead to increased noise and artifacts, which can adversely affect the radiologists' judgment and confidence. Hence, advanced image reconstruction from low-dose CT data is needed to improve the diagnostic performance, which is a challenging problem due to its ill-posed nature. Over the past years, various low-dose CT methods have produced impressive results. However, most of the algorithms developed for this application, including the recently popularized deep learning techniques, aim for minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE) between a denoised CT image and the ground truth under generic penalties. Although the peak signal-to-noise ratio is improved, MSE- or weighted-MSE-based methods can compromise the visibility of important structural details after aggressive denoising. This paper introduces a new CT image denoising method based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) with Wasserstein distance and perceptual similarity. The Wasserstein distance is a key concept of the optimal transport theory and promises to improve the performance of GAN. The perceptual loss suppresses noise by comparing the perceptual features of a denoised output against those of the ground truth in an established feature space, while the GAN focuses more on migrating the data noise distribution from strong to weak statistically. Therefore, our proposed method transfers our knowledge of visual perception to the image denoising task and is capable of not only reducing the image noise level but also trying to keep the critical information at the same time. Promising results have been obtained in our experiments with clinical CT images."
Image-based state-of-the-art techniques for the identification and classification of brain diseases: a review.,2020-Nov,"Ejaz Ul Haq, Jianjun Huang, Li Kang, Hafeez Ul Haq, Tijiang Zhan","Detection and classification methods have a vital and important role in identifying brain diseases. Timely detection and classification of brain diseases enable an accurate identification and effective management of brain impairment. Brain disorders are commonly most spreadable diseases and the diagnosing process is time-consuming and highly expensive. There is an utmost need to develop effective and advantageous methods for brain diseases detection and characterization. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and other various brain imaging scans are used to identify different brain diseases and disorders. Brain imaging scans are the efficient tool to understand the anatomical changes in brain in fast and accurate manner. These different brain imaging scans used with segmentation techniques and along with machine learning and deep learning techniques give maximum accuracy and efficiency. This paper focuses on different conventional approaches, machine learning and deep learning techniques used for the detection, and classification of brain diseases and abnormalities. This paper also summarizes the research gap and problems in the existing techniques used for detection and classification of brain disorders. Comparison and evaluation of different machine learning and deep learning techniques in terms of efficiency and accuracy are also highlighted in this paper. Furthermore, different brain diseases like leukoariaosis, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Wilson's disorder are studied in the scope of machine learning and deep learning techniques."
Sequence Prediction With Sparse Distributed Hyperdimensional Coding Applied to the Analysis of Mobile Phone Use Patterns.,2016-Sep,"Okko J Rasanen, Jukka P Saarinen","Modeling and prediction of temporal sequences is central to many signal processing and machine learning applications. Prediction based on sequence history is typically performed using parametric models, such as fixed-order Markov chains ( n -grams), approximations of high-order Markov processes, such as mixed-order Markov models or mixtures of lagged bigram models, or with other machine learning techniques. This paper presents a method for sequence prediction based on sparse hyperdimensional coding of the sequence structure and describes how higher order temporal structures can be utilized in sparse coding in a balanced manner. The method is purely incremental, allowing real-time online learning and prediction with limited computational resources. Experiments with prediction of mobile phone use patterns, including the prediction of the next launched application, the next GPS location of the user, and the next artist played with the phone media player, reveal that the proposed method is able to capture the relevant variable-order structure from the sequences. In comparison with the n -grams and the mixed-order Markov models, the sparse hyperdimensional predictor clearly outperforms its peers in terms of unweighted average recall and achieves an equal level of weighted average recall as the mixed-order Markov chain but without the batch training of the mixed-order model."

Staging of cervical cancer based on tumor heterogeneity characterized by texture features on (18)F-FDG PET images.,2015-Jul-07,"Wei Mu, Zhe Chen, Ying Liang, Wei Shen, Feng Yang, Ruwei Dai, Ning Wu, Jie Tian","The aim of the study is to assess the staging value of the tumor heterogeneity characterized by texture features and other commonly used semi-quantitative indices extracted from (18)F-FDG PET images of cervical cancer (CC) patients. Forty-two patients suffering CC at different stages were enrolled in this study. Firstly, we proposed a new tumor segmentation method by combining the intensity and gradient field information in a level set framework. Secondly, fifty-four 3D texture features were studied besides of SUVs (SUVmax, SUVmean, SUVpeak) and metabolic tumor volume (MTV). Through correlation analysis, receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves analysis, some independent indices showed statistically significant differences between the early stage (ES, stages I and II) and the advanced stage (AS, stages III and IV). Then the tumors represented by those independent indices could be automatically classified into ES and AS, and the most discriminative feature could be chosen. Finally, the robustness of the optimal index with respect to sampling schemes and the quality of the PET images were validated. Using the proposed segmentation method, the dice similarity coefficient and Hausdorff distance were 91.78   ±   1.66% and 7.94   ±   1.99 mm, respectively. According to the correlation analysis, all the fifty-eight indices could be divided into 20 groups. Six independent indices were selected for their highest areas under the ROC curves (AUROC), and showed significant differences between ES and AS (P  <  0.05). Through automatic classification with the support vector machine (SVM) Classifier, run percentage (RP) was the most discriminative index with the higher accuracy (88.10%) and larger AUROC (0.88). The Pearson correlation of RP under different sampling schemes is 0.9991   ±   0.0011. RP is a highly stable feature and well correlated with tumor stage in CC, which suggests it could differentiate ES and AS with high accuracy."
Voice Disorder Classifications: A Scoping Review - Part A.,2022-Dec-03,"Ana Carolina Constantini, Vanessa Veis Ribeiro, Mara Behlau","Voice is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon of interest to different disciplines. Divergent terminologies and, consequently, classification systems constitute, historically, a difficulty in this field of knowledge, which limits communication between professionals from different countries, backgrounds, and clinical experiences, and well as limiting clinical management and discussion of scientific research findings. This article aims to map and analyze the different diagnostic classifications in voice by describing the findings of a scoping review, consisting of both electronic and manual searches. The results are presented in two parts. In Part A of this article, we explore propositions for comprehensive diagnostic classifications, which involve theoretical frameworks for the constitution of each proposal. The included studies were classified as either articles with theoretical propositions, called G1, or articles using automated computerized classification systems called G2. A total of 44 articles were included: 27 in G1 and 17 in G2. In G1, we found studies from 1947 to 2021, most of which were from the USA, the authors having created theoretical propositions on the subject, considering mainly the etiology of vocal disorder. In G2, we found studies from 2009 onwards, emphasizing automated extraction of acoustic measurements and machine learning to create classification systems. G1 shows the propositions of classifications ranging from two to 11 main groups, each with possible subgroups. In G2, the classifications ranged from four to seven groups, showing preference to distinguish them by descriptions of laryngeal conditions. Conclusion: There is limited convergence between the different theoretical classifications, which is highlighted by the need to create different subgroups, or categories, to include different vocal disorders. The studies with a computerized approach reduce this variability to a certain extent; however, although promising, they should consider theoretical foundations in the proposition of classifications to be applicable to clinical setting."
Lymph Node Metastasis Prediction From In Situ Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma Histopathology Images Using Deep Learning.,2025-Jan,"Lu Xia, Tao Xu, Yongsheng Zheng, Baohua Li, Yongfang Ao, Xun Li, Weijing Wu, Jiabian Lian","Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer, represents a significant portion of lung cancer cases with distinct histologic patterns impacting prognosis and treatment. The current pathological assessment methods face limitations such as interobserver variability, necessitating more reliable techniques. This study seeks to predict lymph node metastasis in LUSC using deep learning models applied to histopathology images of primary tumors, offering a more accurate and objective method for diagnosis and prognosis. Whole slide images (WSIs) from the Outdo-LUSC and the cancer genome atlas cohorts were used to train and validate deep learning models. Multiinstance learning was applied, with patch-level predictions aggregated into WSI-level outcomes. The study employed the ResNet-18 network, transfer learning, and rigorous data preprocessing. To represent WSI features, innovative techniques like patch likelihood histogram and bag of words were used, followed by training of machine learning classifiers, including the ExtraTrees algorithm. The diagnostic model for lymph node metastasis showed strong performance, particularly using the ExtraTrees algorithm, as demonstrated by receiver operating characteristic curves and gradient-weighted class activation mapping visualizations. The signature generated by the ExtraTrees algorithm, named lymph node status-related in situ LUSC histopathology (LN_ISLUSCH), achieved an area under the curve of 0.941 (95% CI: 0.926-0.955) in the training set and 0.788 (95% CI: 0.748-0.827) in the test set. Kaplan-Meier analyses confirmed that the LN_ISLUSCH model was a significant prognostic factor (P = .02). This study underscores the potential of artificial intelligence in enhancing diagnostic precision in pathology. The LN_ISLUSCH model stands out as a promising tool for predicting lymph node metastasis and prognosis in LUSC. Future studies should focus on larger and more diverse cohorts and explore the integration of additional omics data to further refine predictive accuracy and clinical utility."

On the use of AI for Generation of Functional Music to Improve Mental Health.,2020,"Duncan Williams, Victoria J Hodge, Chia-Yu Wu","Increasingly music has been shown to have both physical and mental health benefits including improvements in cardiovascular health, a link to reduction of cases of dementia in elderly populations, and improvements in markers of general mental well-being such as stress reduction. Here, we describe short case studies addressing general mental well-being (anxiety, stress-reduction) through AI-driven music generation. Engaging in active listening and music-making activities (especially for at risk age groups) can be particularly beneficial, and the practice of music therapy has been shown to be helpful in a range of use cases across a wide age range. However, access to music-making can be prohibitive in terms of access to expertize, materials, and cost. Furthermore the use of existing music for functional outcomes (such as targeted improvement in physical and mental health markers suggested above) can be hindered by issues of repetition and subsequent over-familiarity with existing material. In this paper, we describe machine learning approaches which create functional music informed by biophysiological measurement across two case studies, with target emotional states at opposing ends of a Cartesian affective space (a dimensional emotion space with points ranging from descriptors from relaxation, to fear). Galvanic skin response is used as a marker of psychological arousal and as an estimate of emotional state to be used as a control signal in the training of the machine learning algorithm. This algorithm creates a non-linear time series of musical features for sound synthesis ""on-the-fly"", using a perceptually informed musical feature similarity model. We find an interaction between familiarity and perceived emotional response. We also report on subsequent psychometric evaluation of the generated material, and consider how these - and similar techniques - might be useful for a range of functional music generation tasks, for example, in nonlinear sound-tracking such as that found in interactive media or video games."
A Kernel Reinforcement Learning Decoding Framework Integrating Neural and Feedback Signals for Brain Control.,2023-Jul,"Xiang Zhang, Yiwen Wang","Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) have the potential to allow subjects to brain control (BC) external devices, where their brain signals could be translated to the action of the neuro-prosthesis by reinforcement learning (RL) based decoder. During the BC task, feedback cues are provided to guide subject's learning. Subjects will adapt the neural signals according to the feedback cues. Concurrently, the RL decoding parameters are adjusted when the subject explores the BC task through trial and error, leading to a co-adaptive process between the subject and the decoder. However, when subjects receive the feedback cues and enhance their learning, the decoder does not actively utilize the feedback cues. If the RL decoder could integrate both neural signals and feedback cues, the training efficiency of the BC task would increase. A major challenge is the different temporal scales of neural signals and feedback cues, making it difficult to integrate them into a single decoder. In this paper, we propose a novel kernel RL decoding method as the first attempt to combine two signals with different temporal scales for RL decoding. The neural signals and the feedback cues comprise the decoding input, which is then projected into individual Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs) respectively. These two RKHSs form a joint feature space, where the action of the neuro-prosthesis could be decoded linearly. We evaluate the proposed method on a simulated brain control cursor-reaching task. Our proposed method is compared with the kernel RL that only uses neural signals as the input. The proposed method has a faster learning speed and better decoding accuracy. The results demonstrate that our proposed method has successfully integrated the information of the feedback cue and facilitates the training procedure for the BC task.Clinical Relevance-This paper provides an integrated reinforcement learning decoding framework, which combines the neural signals and the feedback cues to increase the learning speed and the accuracy of the brain control task.

A Machine Learning Understanding of Sepsis.,2021-Nov,"Manish Shetty, Soumya Mary Alex, Merlin Moni, Fabia Edathadathil, Preetha Prasanna, Veena Menon, Vidya P Menon, Prashanth Athri, Gowri Srinivasa","Sepsis is a serious cause of morbidity and mortality and yet its pathophysiology remains elusive. Recently, medical and technological advances have helped redefine the criteria for sepsis incidence, which is otherwise poorly understood. With the recording of clinical parameters and outcomes of patients, enabling technologies, such as machine learning, open avenues for early prognostic systems for sepsis. In this work, we propose a two-phase approach towards prognostic scoring by predicting two outcomes in sepsis patients - Sepsis Severity and Comorbidity Severity. We train and evaluate multiple machine learning models on a dataset of 80 parameters collected from 800 patients at Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, Kerala, India. We present an analysis of these results and harmonize consistencies and/or contradictions between elements of human knowledge and that of the model, using local interpretable model-agnostic explanations and other methods."
Deep Learning Diffuse Optical Tomography.,2020-Apr,"Jaejun Yoo, Sohail Sabir, Duchang Heo, Kee Hyun Kim, Abdul Wahab, Yoonseok Choi, Seul-I Lee, Eun Young Chae, Hak Hee Kim, Young Min Bae, Young-Wook Choi, Seungryong Cho, Jong Chul Ye","Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) has been investigated as an alternative imaging modality for breast cancer detection thanks to its excellent contrast to hemoglobin oxidization level. However, due to the complicated non-linear photon scattering physics and ill-posedness, the conventional reconstruction algorithms are sensitive to imaging parameters such as boundary conditions. To address this, here we propose a novel deep learning approach that learns non-linear photon scattering physics and obtains an accurate three dimensional (3D) distribution of optical anomalies. In contrast to the traditional black-box deep learning approaches, our deep network is designed to invert the Lippman-Schwinger integral equation using the recent mathematical theory of deep convolutional framelets. As an example of clinical relevance, we applied the method to our prototype DOT system. We show that our deep neural network, trained with only simulation data, can accurately recover the location of anomalies within biomimetic phantoms and live animals without the use of an exogenous contrast agent."
Brain functional connectivity patterns for emotional state classification in Parkinson's disease patients without dementia.,2016-Feb-01,"R Yuvaraj, M Murugappan, U Rajendra Acharya, Hojjat Adeli, Norlinah Mohamed Ibrahim, Edgar Mesquita","Successful emotional communication is crucial for social interactions and social relationships. Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients have shown deficits in emotional recognition abilities although the research findings are inconclusive. This paper presents an investigation of six emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and disgust) of twenty non-demented (Mini-Mental State Examination score >24) PD patients and twenty Healthy Controls (HCs) using Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based Brain Functional Connectivity (BFC) patterns. The functional connectivity index feature in EEG signals is computed using three different methods: Correlation (COR), Coherence (COH), and Phase Synchronization Index (PSI). Further, a new functional connectivity index feature is proposed using bispectral analysis. The experimental results indicate that the BFC change is significantly different among emotional states of PD patients compared with HC. Also, the emotional connectivity pattern classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier yielded the highest accuracy for the new bispectral functional connectivity index. The PD patients showed emotional impairments as demonstrated by a poor classification performance. This finding suggests that decrease in the functional connectivity indices during emotional stimulation in PD, indicating functional disconnections between cortical areas."
Dissociable default-mode subnetworks subserve childhood attention and cognitive flexibility: Evidence from deep learning and stereotactic electroencephalography.,2023-Oct,"Nebras M Warsi, Simeon M Wong, Jürgen Germann, Alexandre Boutet, Olivia N Arski, Ryan Anderson, Lauren Erdman, Han Yan, Hrishikesh Suresh, Flavia Venetucci Gouveia, Aaron Loh, Gavin J B Elias, Elizabeth Kerr, Mary Lou Smith, Ayako Ochi, Hiroshi Otsubo, Roy Sharma, Puneet Jain, Elizabeth Donner, Andres M Lozano, O Carter Snead, George M Ibrahim","Cognitive flexibility encompasses the ability to efficiently shift focus and forms a critical component of goal-directed attention. The neural substrates of this process are incompletely understood in part due to difficulties in sampling the involved circuitry. We leverage stereotactic intracranial recordings to directly resolve local-field potentials from otherwise inaccessible structures to study moment-to-moment attentional activity in children with epilepsy performing a flexible attentional task. On an individual subject level, we employed deep learning to decode neural features predictive of task performance indexed by single-trial reaction time. These models were subsequently aggregated across participants to identify predictive brain regions based on AAL atlas and FIND functional network parcellations. Through this approach, we show that fluctuations in beta (12-30 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) power reflective of increased top-down attentional control and local neuronal processing within relevant large-scale networks can accurately predict single-trial task performance. We next performed connectomic profiling of these highly predictive nodes to examine task-related engagement of distributed functional networks, revealing exclusive recruitment of the dorsal default mode network during shifts in attention. The identification of distinct substreams within the default mode system supports a key role for this network in cognitive flexibility and attention in children. Furthermore, convergence of our results onto consistent functional networks despite significant inter-subject variability in electrode implantations supports a broader role for deep learning applied to intracranial electrodes in the study of human attention."
Rapid screening of classic galactosemia patients: a proof-of-concept study using high-throughput FTIR analysis of plasma.,2015-Apr-07,"Caroline Lacombe, Valérie Untereiner, Cyril Gobinet, Mokhtar Zater, Ganesh D Sockalingum, Roselyne Garnotel","Classic galactosemia is an autosomal recessive metabolic disease involving the galactose pathway, caused by the deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. Galactose accumulation induces in newborns many symptoms, such as liver disease, cataracts, and sepsis leading to death if untreated. Neonatal screening is developed and applied in many countries using several methods to detect galactose or its derived product accumulation in blood or urine. High-throughput FTIR spectroscopy was investigated as a potential tool in the current screening methods. IR spectra were obtained from blood plasma of healthy, diabetic, and galactosemic patients. The major spectral differences were in the carbohydrate region, which was first analysed in an exploratory manner using principal component analysis (PCA). PCA score plots showed a clear discrimination between diabetic and galactosemic patients and this was more marked as a function of the glucose and galactose increased concentration in these patients' plasma respectively. Then, a support vector machine leave-one-out cross-validation (SVM-LOOCV) classifier was built with the PCA scores as the input and the model was tested on median, mean and all spectra from the three population groups. This classifier was able to discriminate healthy/diabetic, healthy/galactosemic, and diabetic/galactosemic patients with sensitivity and specificity rates ranging from 80% to 94%. The total accuracy rate ranged from 87% to 96%. High-throughput FTIR spectroscopy combined with the SVM-LOOCV classification procedure appears to be a promising tool in the screening of galactosemia patients, with good sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, this approach presents the advantages of being cost-effective, fast, and straightforward in the screening of galactosemic patients."
Imaging Beyond Seeing: Early Prognosis of Cancer Treatment.,2021-Mar,"Changrong Shi, Zijian Zhou, Hongyu Lin, Jinhao Gao","Assessing cancer response to therapeutic interventions has been realized as an important course to early predict curative efficacy and treatment outcomes due to tumor heterogeneity. Compared to the traditional invasive tissue biopsy method, molecular imaging techniques have fundamentally revolutionized the ability to evaluate cancer response in a spatiotemporal manner. The past few years has witnessed a paradigm shift on the efforts from manufacturing functional molecular imaging probes for seeing a tumor to a vantage stage of interpreting the tumor response during different treatments. This review is to stand by the current development of advanced imaging technologies aiming to predict the treatment response in cancer therapy. Special interest is placed on the systems that are able to provide rapid and noninvasive assessment of pharmacokinetic drug fates (e.g., drug distribution, release, and activation) and tumor microenvironment heterogeneity (e.g., tumor cells, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), T cells, and inflammatory cells). The current status, practical significance, and future challenges of the emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technology and machine learning in the applications of medical imaging fields is overviewed. Ultimately, the authors hope that this review is timely to spur research interest in molecular imaging and precision medicine."
Reconstructing growth and dynamic trajectories from single-cell transcriptomics data.,2024,"Yutong Sha, Yuchi Qiu, Peijie Zhou, Qing Nie","Time-series single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets provide unprecedented opportunities to learn dynamic processes of cellular systems. Due to the destructive nature of sequencing, it remains challenging to link the scRNA-seq snapshots sampled at different time points. Here we present TIGON, a dynamic, unbalanced optimal transport algorithm that reconstructs dynamic trajectories and population growth simultaneously as well as the underlying gene regulatory network from multiple snapshots. To tackle the high-dimensional optimal transport problem, we introduce a deep learning method using a dimensionless formulation based on the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) distance. TIGON is evaluated on simulated data and compared with existing methods for its robustness and accuracy in predicting cell state transition and cell population growth. Using three scRNA-seq datasets, we show the importance of growth in the temporal inference, TIGON's capability in reconstructing gene expression at unmeasured time points and its applications to temporal gene regulatory networks and cell-cell communication inference."
Capturing heterogeneous group differences using mixture-of-experts: Application to a study of aging.,2016-Jan-15,"Harini Eavani, Meng Kang Hsieh, Yang An, Guray Erus, Lori Beason-Held, Susan Resnick, Christos Davatzikos","In MRI studies, linear multi-variate methods are often employed to identify regions or connections that are affected due to disease or normal aging. Such linear models inherently assume that there is a single, homogeneous abnormality pattern that is present in all affected individuals. While kernel-based methods can implicitly model a non-linear effect, and therefore the heterogeneity in the affected group, extracting and interpreting information about affected regions is difficult. In this paper, we present a method that explicitly models and captures heterogeneous patterns of change in the affected group relative to a reference group of controls. For this purpose, we use the Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) framework, which combines unsupervised modeling of mixtures of distributions with supervised learning of classifiers. MOE approximates the non-linear boundary between the two groups with a piece-wise linear boundary, thus allowing discovery of multiple patterns of group differences. In the case of patient/control comparisons, each such pattern aims to capture a different dimension of a disease, and hence to identify patient subgroups. We validated our model using multiple simulation scenarios and performance measures. We applied this method to resting state functional MRI data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, to investigate heterogeneous effects of aging on brain function in cognitively normal older adults (>85years) relative to a reference group of normal young to middle-aged adults (<60years). We found strong evidence for the presence of two subgroups of older adults, with similar age distributions in each subgroup, but different connectivity patterns associated with aging. While both older subgroups showed reduced functional connectivity in the Default Mode Network (DMN), increases in functional connectivity within the pre-frontal cortex as well as the bilateral insula were observed only for one of the two subgroups. Interestingly, the subgroup showing this increased connectivity (unlike the other subgroup) was, cognitively similar at baseline to the young and middle-aged subjects in two of seven cognitive domains, and had a faster rate of cognitive decline in one of seven domains. These results suggest that older individuals whose baseline cognitive performance is comparable to that of younger individuals recruit their ""cognitive reserve"" later in life, to compensate for reduced connectivity in other brain regions."
Quantitative Analysis of Soil Total Nitrogen Using Hyperspectral Imaging Technology with Extreme Learning Machine.,2019-Oct-09,"Hongyang Li, Shengyao Jia, Zichun Le","Soil nutrient detection is important for precise fertilization. A total of 150 soil samples were picked from Lishui City. In this work, the total nitrogen (TN) content in soil samples was detected in the spectral range of 900-1700 nm using a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system. Characteristic wavelengths were extracted using uninformative variable elimination (UVE) and the successive projections algorithm (SPA), separately. Partial least squares (PLS) and extreme learning machine (ELM) were used to establish the calibration models with full spectra and characteristic wavelengths, respectively. The results indicated that the prediction effect of the nonlinear ELM model was superior to the linear PLS model.

Antidepressant Treatment Response Prediction With Early Assessment of Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and Micro-RNA.,2025,"Lok Hua Lee, Cyrus Su Hui Ho, Yee Ling Chan, Gabrielle Wann Nii Tay, Cheng-Kai Lu, Tong Boon Tang","While functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) had previously been suggested for major depressive disorder (MDD) diagnosis, the clinical application to predict antidepressant treatment response (ATR) is still unclear. To address this, the aim of the current study is to investigate MDD ATR at three response levels using fNIRS and micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs). Our proposed algorithm includes a custom inter-subject variability reduction based on the principal component analysis (PCA). The principal components of extracted features are first identified for non-responders' group. The first few components that sum up to 99% of explained variance are discarded to minimize inter-subject variability while the remaining projection vectors are applied on all response groups (24 non-responders, 15 partial-responders, 13 responders) to obtain their relative projections in feature space. The entire algorithm achieved a better performance through the radial basis function (RBF) support vector machine (SVM), with 82.70% accuracy, 78.44% sensitivity, 86.15% precision, and 91.02% specificity, respectively, when compared with conventional machine learning approaches that combine clinical, sociodemographic and genetic information as the predictor. The performance of the proposed custom algorithm suggests the prediction of ATR can be improved with multiple features sources, provided that the inter-subject variability is properly addressed, and can be an effective tool for clinical decision support system in MDD ATR prediction. Clinical and Translational Impact Statement-The fusion of neuroimaging fNIRS features and miRNA profiles significantly enhances the prediction accuracy of MDD ATR. The minimally required features also make the personalized medicine more practical and realizable."

scPred: accurate supervised method for cell-type classification from single-cell RNA-seq data.,2019-Dec-12,"Jose Alquicira-Hernandez, Anuja Sathe, Hanlee P Ji, Quan Nguyen, Joseph E Powell","Single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled the characterization of highly specific cell types in many tissues, as well as both primary and stem cell-derived cell lines. An important facet of these studies is the ability to identify the transcriptional signatures that define a cell type or state. In theory, this information can be used to classify an individual cell based on its transcriptional profile. Here, we present scPred, a new generalizable method that is able to provide highly accurate classification of single cells, using a combination of unbiased feature selection from a reduced-dimension space, and machine-learning probability-based prediction method. We apply scPred to scRNA-seq data from pancreatic tissue, mononuclear cells, colorectal tumor biopsies, and circulating dendritic cells and show that scPred is able to classify individual cells with high accuracy.

Topological Data Analysis for Eye Fundus Image Quality Assessment.,2021-Jul-23,"Gener José Avilés-Rodríguez, Juan Iván Nieto-Hipólito, María de Los Ángeles Cosío-León, Gerardo Salvador Romo-Cárdenas, Juan de Dios Sánchez-López, Patricia Radilla-Chávez, Mabel Vázquez-Briseño","The objective of this work is to perform image quality assessment (IQA) of eye fundus images in the context of digital fundoscopy with topological data analysis (TDA) and machine learning methods. Eye health remains inaccessible for a large amount of the global population. Digital tools that automize the eye exam could be used to address this issue. IQA is a fundamental step in digital fundoscopy for clinical applications; it is one of the first steps in the preprocessing stages of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems using eye fundus images. Images from the EyePACS dataset were used, and quality labels from previous works in the literature were selected. Cubical complexes were used to represent the images; the grayscale version was, then, used to calculate a persistent homology on the simplex and represented with persistence diagrams. Then, 30 vectorized topological descriptors were calculated from each image and used as input to a classification algorithm. Six different algorithms were tested for this study (SVM, decision tree, k-NN, random forest, logistic regression (LoGit), MLP). LoGit was selected and used for the classification of all images, given the low computational cost it carries. Performance results on the validation subset showed a global accuracy of 0.932, precision of 0.912 for label ""quality"" and 0.952 for label ""no quality"", recall of 0.932 for label ""quality"" and 0.912 for label ""no quality"", AUC of 0.980, F1 score of 0.932, and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.864. This work offers evidence for the use of topological methods for the process of quality assessment of eye fundus images, where a relatively small vector of characteristics (30 in this case) can enclose enough information for an algorithm to yield classification results useful in the clinical settings of a digital fundoscopy pipeline for CAD."

The Application of Machine Learning in Doping Detection.,2024-Dec-09,"Qingqing Yang, Wennuo Xu, Xiaodong Sun, Qin Chen, Bing Niu","Detecting doping agents in sports poses a significant challenge due to the continuous emergence of new prohibited substances and methods. Traditional detection methods primarily rely on targeted analysis, which is often labor-intensive and is susceptible to errors. In response, machine learning offers a transformative approach to enhancing doping screening and detection. With its powerful data analysis capabilities, machine learning enables the rapid identification of patterns and features in complex compound data, increasing both the efficiency and the accuracy of detection. Moreover, when integrated with nontargeted metabolomics, machine learning can predict unknown metabolites, aiding the discovery of long-lasting biomarkers of doping. It also excels in classifying novel compounds, thereby reducing false-negative rates. As instrumental analysis and machine learning technologies continue to advance, the development of rapid, scalable, and highly efficient doping detection methods becomes increasingly feasible, supporting the pursuit of fairness and integrity in sports competitions."
Modelling the dynamics of expiratory airflow to describe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,2014-Dec,"Marko Topalovic, Vasileios Exadaktylos, Marc Decramer, Thierry Troosters, Daniel Berckmans, Wim Janssens","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by expiratory airflow limitation, but current diagnostic criteria only consider flow till the first second and are therefore strongly debated. We aimed to develop a data-based individualized model for flow decline and to explore the relationship between model parameters and COPD presence. A second-order transfer function model was chosen and the model parameters (namely the two poles and the steady state gain (SSG)) from 474 individuals were correlated with COPD presence. The capability of the model to predict disease presence was explored using 5 machine learning classifiers and tenfold cross-validation. Median (95% CI) poles in subjects without disease were 0.9868 (0.9858-0.9878) and 0.9333 (0.9256-0.9395), compared with 0.9929 (0.9925-0.9933) and 0.9082 (0.9004-0.9140) in subjects with COPD (p < 0.001 for both poles). A significant difference was also found when analysing the SSG, being lower in COPD group 3.8 (3.5-4.2) compared with 8.2 (7.8-8.7) in subjects without (p < 0.0001). A combination of all three parameters in a support vector machines corresponded with highest sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 98.1% and accuracy of 88.2% to COPD diagnosis. The forced expiration of COPD can be modelled by a second-order system which parameters identify most COPD cases. Our approach offers an additional tool in case FEV1/FVC ratio-based diagnosis is doubted."
Outlier-based detection of unusual patient-management actions: An ICU study.,2016-Dec,"Milos Hauskrecht, Iyad Batal, Charmgil Hong, Quang Nguyen, Gregory F Cooper, Shyam Visweswaran, Gilles Clermont","Medical errors remain a significant problem in healthcare. This paper investigates a data-driven outlier-based monitoring and alerting framework that uses data in the Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) repositories of past patient cases to identify any unusual clinical actions in the EMR of a current patient. Our conjecture is that these unusual clinical actions correspond to medical errors often enough to justify their detection and alerting. Our approach works by using EMR repositories to learn statistical models that relate patient states to patient-management actions. We evaluated this approach on the EMR data for 24,658 intensive care unit (ICU) patient cases. A total of 16,500 cases were used to train statistical models for ordering medications and laboratory tests given the patient state summarizing the patient's clinical history. The models were applied to a separate test set of 8158 ICU patient cases and used to generate alerts. A subset of 240 alerts generated by the models were evaluated and assessed by eighteen ICU clinicians. The overall true positive rates for the alerts (TPARs) ranged from 0.44 to 0.71. The TPAR for medication order alerts specifically ranged from 0.31 to 0.61 and for laboratory order alerts from 0.44 to 0.75. These results support outlier-based alerting as a promising new approach to data-driven clinical alerting that is generated automatically based on past EMR data."
Classification of ECG signal using FFT based improved Alexnet classifier.,2022,"Arun Kumar M, Arvind Chakrapani","Electrocardiograms (ECG) are extensively used for the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias. This paper investigates the use of machine learning classification algorithms for ECG analysis and arrhythmia detection. This is a crucial component of a conventional electronic health system, and it frequently necessitates ECG signal reduction for long-term data storage and remote transmission. Signal processing methods must be used to extract the function of the morphological properties of the ECG signal changing with time, which is difficult to discern in the typical visual depiction of the ECG signal. In biomedical research, signal processing and data analysis are commonly employed methodologies. This work proposes the use of an ECG arrhythmia classification method based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for feature extraction and an improved AlexNet classifier to distinguish the difference between four types of arrhythmia conditions that were collected from records. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm's results are compared to those of other algorithms, and the simulation results prove that the proposed technique is more effective for various parameters. The final results of the proposed system show that its ability to find deviations is 20% better than that of traditional systems."
"An Insider Data Leakage Detection Using One-Hot Encoding, Synthetic Minority Oversampling and Machine Learning Techniques.",2021-Sep-27,"Taher Al-Shehari, Rakan A Alsowail","Insider threats are malicious acts that can be carried out by an authorized employee within an organization. Insider threats represent a major cybersecurity challenge for private and public organizations, as an insider attack can cause extensive damage to organization assets much more than external attacks. Most existing approaches in the field of insider threat focused on detecting general insider attack scenarios. However, insider attacks can be carried out in different ways, and the most dangerous one is a data leakage attack that can be executed by a malicious insider before his/her leaving an organization. This paper proposes a machine learning-based model for detecting such serious insider threat incidents. The proposed model addresses the possible bias of detection results that can occur due to an inappropriate encoding process by employing the feature scaling and one-hot encoding techniques. Furthermore, the imbalance issue of the utilized dataset is also addressed utilizing the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Well known machine learning algorithms are employed to detect the most accurate classifier that can detect data leakage events executed by malicious insiders during the sensitive period before they leave an organization. We provide a proof of concept for our model by applying it on CMU-CERT Insider Threat Dataset and comparing its performance with the ground truth. The experimental results show that our model detects insider data leakage events with an AUC-ROC value of 0.99, outperforming the existing approaches that are validated on the same dataset. The proposed model provides effective methods to address possible bias and class imbalance issues for the aim of devising an effective insider data leakage detection system."
Machine Learning EEG to Predict Cognitive Functioning and Processing Speed Over a 2-Year Period in Multiple Sclerosis Patients and Controls.,2018-May,"Hanni Kiiski, Lee Jollans, Seán Ó Donnchadha, Hugh Nolan, Róisín Lonergan, Siobhán Kelly, Marie Claire O'Brien, Katie Kinsella, Jessica Bramham, Teresa Burke, Michael Hutchinson, Niall Tubridy, Richard B Reilly, Robert Whelan","Event-related potentials (ERPs) show promise to be objective indicators of cognitive functioning. The aim of the study was to examine if ERPs recorded during an oddball task would predict cognitive functioning and information processing speed in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients and controls at the individual level. Seventy-eight participants (35 MS patients, 43 healthy age-matched controls) completed visual and auditory 2- and 3-stimulus oddball tasks with 128-channel EEG, and a neuropsychological battery, at baseline (month 0) and at Months 13 and 26. ERPs from 0 to 700 ms and across the whole scalp were transformed into 1728 individual spatio-temporal datapoints per participant. A machine learning method that included penalized linear regression used the entire spatio-temporal ERP to predict composite scores of both cognitive functioning and processing speed at baseline (month 0), and months 13 and 26. The results showed ERPs during the visual oddball tasks could predict cognitive functioning and information processing speed at baseline and a year later in a sample of MS patients and healthy controls. In contrast, ERPs during auditory tasks were not predictive of cognitive performance. These objective neurophysiological indicators of cognitive functioning and processing speed, and machine learning methods that can interrogate high-dimensional data, show promise in outcome prediction."

EEG channel and feature investigation in binary and multiple motor imagery task predictions.,2024,"Murside Degirmenci, Yilmaz Kemal Yuce, Matjaž Perc, Yalcin Isler","Motor Imagery (MI) Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are non-stationary and dynamic physiological signals which have low signal-to-noise ratio. Hence, it is difficult to achieve high classification accuracy. Although various machine learning methods have already proven useful to that effect, the use of many features and ineffective EEG channels often leads to a complex structure of classifier algorithms. State-of-the-art studies were interested in improving classification performance with complex feature extraction and classification methods by neglecting detailed EEG channel and feature investigation in predicting MI tasks from EEGs. Here, we investigate the effects of the statistically significant feature selection method on four different feature domains (time-domain, frequency-domain, time-frequency domain, and non-linear domain) and their two different combinations to reduce the number of features and classify MI-EEG features by comparing low-dimensional matrices with well-known machine learning algorithms."
Information-Based Boundary Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Networks with Interpretable Representation Learning.,2018,"Junghoon Hah, Woojin Lee, Jaewook Lee, Saerom Park","This paper describes a new image generation algorithm based on generative adversarial network. With an information-theoretic extension to the autoencoder-based discriminator, this new algorithm is able to learn interpretable representations from the input images. Our model not only adversarially minimizes the Wasserstein distance-based losses of the discriminator and generator but also maximizes the mutual information between small subset of the latent variables and the observation. We also train our model with proportional control theory to keep the equilibrium between the discriminator and the generator balanced, and as a result, our generative adversarial network can mitigate the convergence problem. Through the experiments on real images, we validate our proposed method, which can manipulate the generated images as desired by controlling the latent codes of input variables. In addition, the visual qualities of produced images are effectively maintained, and the model can stably converge to the equilibrium. However, our model has a difficulty in learning disentangling factors because our model does not regularize the independence between the interpretable factors. Therefore, in the future, we will develop a generative model that can learn disentangling factors."

In order to extract useful gene information from cancer microarray data and reduce dimensionality, feature selection algorithms were systematically investigated in this study. Using a correlation-based feature selector combined with machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, naïve Bayes and support vector machines, we show that classification performance at least as good as published results can be obtained on acute leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma microarray data sets. We also demonstrate that a combined use of different classification and feature selection approaches makes it possible to select relevant genes with high confidence. This is also the first paper which discusses both computational and biological evidence for the involvement of zyxin in leukaemogenesis."

Identification and Classification of Images in e-Cigarette-Related Content on TikTok: Unsupervised Machine Learning Image Clustering Approach.,2025,"Juhan Lee, Dhiraj Murthy, Rachel Ouellette, Tanvi Anand, Grace Kong","Previous studies identified e-cigarette content on popular video and image-based social media platforms such as TikTok. While machine learning approaches have been increasingly used with text-based social media data, image-based analysis such as image-clustering has been rarely used on TikTok. Image clustering can identify underlying patterns and structures across large sets of images, enabling more streamlined distillation and analysis of visual data on TikTok. This study used image-clustering approaches to examine e-cigarette-related images on TikTok."
An artificial niche preserves the quiescence of muscle stem cells and enhances their therapeutic efficacy.,2016-Jul,"Marco Quarta, Jamie O Brett, Rebecca DiMarco, Antoine De Morree, Stephane C Boutet, Robert Chacon, Michael C Gibbons, Victor A Garcia, James Su, Joseph B Shrager, Sarah Heilshorn, Thomas A Rando","A promising therapeutic strategy for diverse genetic disorders involves transplantation of autologous stem cells that have been genetically corrected ex vivo. A major challenge in such approaches is a loss of stem cell potency during culture. Here we describe an artificial niche for maintaining muscle stem cells (MuSCs) in vitro in a potent, quiescent state. Using a machine learning method, we identified a molecular signature of quiescence and used it to screen for factors that could maintain mouse MuSC quiescence, thus defining a quiescence medium (QM). We also engineered muscle fibers that mimic the native myofiber of the MuSC niche. Mouse MuSCs maintained in QM on engineered fibers showed enhanced potential for engraftment, tissue regeneration and self-renewal after transplantation in mice. An artificial niche adapted to human cells similarly extended the quiescence of human MuSCs in vitro and enhanced their potency in vivo. Our approach for maintaining quiescence may be applicable to stem cells isolated from other tissues."

Current role of machine learning and radiogenomics in precision neuro-oncology.,2023,"Teresa Perillo, Marco de Giorgi, Umberto Maria Papace, Antonietta Serino, Renato Cuocolo, Andrea Manto","In the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly used to create tools that can enhance workflow in medicine. In particular, neuro-oncology has benefited from the use of AI and especially machine learning (ML) and radiogenomics, which are subfields of AI. ML can be used to develop algorithms that dynamically learn from available medical data in order to automatically do specific tasks. On the other hand, radiogenomics can identify relationships between tumor genetics and imaging features, thus possibly giving new insights into the pathophysiology of tumors. Therefore, ML and radiogenomics could help treatment tailoring, which is crucial in personalized neuro-oncology. The aim of this review is to illustrate current and possible future applications of ML and radiomics in neuro-oncology."
Neural robust stabilization via event-triggering mechanism and adaptive learning technique.,2018-Jun,"Ding Wang, Derong Liu","The robust control synthesis of continuous-time nonlinear systems with uncertain term is investigated via event-triggering mechanism and adaptive critic learning technique. We mainly focus on combining the event-triggering mechanism with adaptive critic designs, so as to solve the nonlinear robust control problem. This can not only make better use of computation and communication resources, but also conduct controller design from the view of intelligent optimization. Through theoretical analysis, the nonlinear robust stabilization can be achieved by obtaining an event-triggered optimal control law of the nominal system with a newly defined cost function and a certain triggering condition. The adaptive critic technique is employed to facilitate the event-triggered control design, where a neural network is introduced as an approximator of the learning phase. The performance of the event-triggered robust control scheme is validated via simulation studies and comparisons. The present method extends the application domain of both event-triggered control and adaptive critic control to nonlinear systems possessing dynamical uncertainties."

Enhancing arsenic sequestration on ameliorated waste molasses nanoadsorbents using response surface methodology and machine-learning frameworks.,2021-Mar,"Julie Baruah, Chayanika Chaliha, Bikash Kar Nath, Eeshan Kalita","The development of a novel nanobiosorbent derived from waste molasses for the adsorptive removal of arsenic (As) has been attempted in this study. Waste molasses were chemically ameliorated through a solvothermal route for the incorporation of iron oxide, thereby producing iron oxide incorporated carbonaceous nanomaterial (IOCN). Synthesis of IOCN was confirmed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and atomic emission spectroscopy (AES) analysis. The surface area and porous behavior of IOCN were elucidated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) assessments. The experimental conditions for adsorption were first modeled using response surface methodology (RSM) based on the central composite design (CCD), considering the parameters: adsorbate dosage, adsorbent dosage, pH, and contact time. RSM optimizations were improved upon using a three-layer feed-forward multilayer perceptron (MLP) based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. Optimization through ANN model resulted in the increase of the maximal As adsorption efficiency to ~ 96% for IOCN. The IOCN isotherm plots show the best fit for the Sips isotherm, and the reaction kinetics follows the pseudo-second-order model, indicating the chemisorption mechanism for As adsorption. Evidence for direct coordination of As to the surface of adsorbents was further confirmed by FTIR spectroscopic studies before and after As adsorption. The high adsorption efficiencies and the low-cost facile synthesis of the IOCN nanosorbent from agro-industrial waste indicate their potential for commercial applications."
Nonnegative least-squares methods for the classification of high-dimensional biological data.,2013,"Yifeng Li, Alioune Ngom","Microarray data can be used to detect diseases and predict responses to therapies through classification models. However, the high dimensionality and low sample size of such data result in many computational problems such as reduced prediction accuracy and slow classification speed. In this paper, we propose a novel family of nonnegative least-squares classifiers for high-dimensional microarray gene expression and comparative genomic hybridization data. Our approaches are based on combining the advantages of using local learning, transductive learning, and ensemble learning, for better prediction performance. To study the performances of our methods, we performed computational experiments on 17 well-known data sets with diverse characteristics. We have also performed statistical comparisons with many classification techniques including the well-performing SVM approach and two related but recent methods proposed in literature. Experimental results show that our approaches are faster and achieve generally a better prediction performance over compared methods."
An ensemble system for automatic sleep stage classification using single channel EEG signal.,2012-Dec,"B Koley, D Dey","The present work aims at automatic identification of various sleep stages like, sleep stages 1, 2, slow wave sleep (sleep stages 3 and 4), REM sleep and wakefulness from single channel EEG signal. Automatic scoring of sleep stages was performed with the help of pattern recognition technique which involves feature extraction, selection and finally classification. Total 39 numbers of features from time domain, frequency domain and from non-linear analysis were extracted. After extraction of features, SVM based recursive feature elimination (RFE) technique was used to find the optimum number of feature subset which can provide significant classification performance with reduced number of features for the five different sleep stages. Finally for classification, binary SVMs were combined with one-against-all (OAA) strategy. Careful extraction and selection of optimum feature subset helped to reduce the classification error to 8.9% for training dataset, validated by k-fold cross-validation (CV) technique and 10.61% in the case of independent testing dataset. Agreement of the estimated sleep stages with those obtained by expert scoring for all sleep stages of training dataset was 0.877 and for independent testing dataset it was 0.8572. The proposed ensemble SVM-based method could be used as an efficient and cost-effective method for sleep staging with the advantage of reducing stress and burden imposed on subjects."

Prediction of osteoporosis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis using machine learning.,2023-Dec-09,"Chaewon Lee, Gihun Joo, Seunghun Shin, Hyeonseung Im, Ki Won Moon","Osteoporosis is a serious health concern in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Machine learning (ML) models have been increasingly incorporated into various clinical practices, including disease classification, risk prediction, and treatment response. However, only a few studies have focused on predicting osteoporosis using ML in patients with RA. We aimed to develop an ML model to predict osteoporosis using a representative Korean RA cohort database. The KORean Observational study Network for Arthritis (KORONA) database, established by the Clinical Research Center for RA in Korea, was used in this study. Among the 5077 patients registered in KORONA, 2374 patients were included in this study. Four representative ML algorithms were used for the prediction: logistic regression (LR), random forest, XGBoost (XGB), and LightGBM. The accuracy, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC) of each model were measured. The LR model achieved the highest AUC value at 0.750, while the XGB model achieved the highest accuracy at 0.682. Body mass index, age, menopause, waist and hip circumferences, RA surgery, and monthly income were risk factors of osteoporosis. In conclusion, ML algorithms are a useful option for screening for osteoporosis in patients with RA."

Privacy Is Dead - Solutions for Privacy-Enabled Collections and Use of Personal Health Information in Digital Era.,2020-Sep-04,"Pekka Ruotsalainen, Bernd Blobel","Today's digital information systems and applications collect every day a huge amount of personal health information (PHI) from sensor and surveillance systems, and every time we use personal computers or mobile phones. Collected data is processed in clouds, platforms and ecosystems by digital algorithms and machine learning. Pervasive technology, insufficient and ineffective privacy legislation, strong ICT industry and low political will to protect data subject's privacy have together made it almost impossible for a user to know what PHI is collected, how it is used and to whom it is disclosed. Service providers' and organizations' privacy policy documents are cumbersome and they do not guarantee that PHI is not misused. Instead, service users are expected to blindly trust in privacy promises made. In spite of that, majority of individuals are concerned of their privacy, and governments' assurance that they meet the responsibility to protect citizens in real life privacy is actually dead. Because PHI is probably the most sensitive data we have, and the authors claim it cannot be a commodity or public good, they have studied novel privacy approaches to find a way out from the current unsatisfactory situation. Based on findings got, the authors have developed a promising solution for privacy-enabled use of PHI. It is a combination of the concept of information fiduciary duty, Privacy as Trust approach, and privacy by smart contract. This approach shifts the onus of privacy protection onto data collectors and service providers. A specific information fiduciary duty law is needed to harmonize privacy requirements and force the acceptance of proposed solutions. Furthermore, the authors have studied strengths and weaknesses of existing or emerging solutions."
Interrogative suggestibility in the elderly.,2020,"Silvia Biondi, Cristina Mazza, Graziella Orrù, Merylin Monaro, Stefano Ferracuti, Eleonora Ricci, Alberto Di Domenico, Paolo Roma","Interrogative suggestibility (IS) describes the extent to which an individual behavioral response is affected by messages communicated during formal questioning within a closed social interaction. The present study aimed at improving knowledge about IS in the elderly (aged 65 years and older), in particular about its association with both emotive/affective and cognitive variables. The sample (N = 172) was divided into three groups on the basis of age: late adult (aged 55-64, N = 59), young elderly (aged 65-74, N = 63), and elderly (aged 75 and older, N = 50). Cognitive (i.e., Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test-2, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test), emotive/affective (i.e., Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale, Penn State Worry Questionnaire) and suggestibility measures (i.e., Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale-2) were administered. In order to identify differences and associations between groups in IS, cognitive and emotive/affective variables, ANOVAs tests and Pearson's correlations were run. Furthermore, moderation analyses and hierarchical regression were set to determine whether age, cognitive and emotive/affective variables predicted IS components (i.e., Yield and Shift). Finally, machine learning models were developed to highlight the best strategy for classifying elderly subjects with high suggestibility. The results corroborated the significant link between IS and age, showing that elderly participants had the worst performance on all suggestibility indexes. Age was also the most important predictor of both Yield and Shift. Results also confirmed the important role of non-verbal intelligence and memory impairment in explaining IS dimensions, showing that these associations were stronger in young elderly and elderly groups. Implications about interrogative procedures with older adults were discussed."
The Synergy Between PAV and AdaBoost.,2005-Nov,"W John Wilbur, Lana Yeganova, Won Kim",Schapire and Singer's improved version of AdaBoost for handling weak hypotheses with confidence rated predictions represents an important advance in the theory and practice of boosting. Its success results from a more efficient use of information in weak hypotheses during updating. Instead of simple binary voting a weak hypothesis is allowed to vote for or against a classification with a variable strength or confidence. The Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV) algorithm is a method for converting a score into a probability. We show how PAV may be applied to a weak hypothesis to yield a new weak hypothesis which is in a sense an ideal confidence rated prediction and that this leads to an optimal updating for AdaBoost. The result is a new algorithm which we term PAV-AdaBoost. We give several examples illustrating problems for which this new algorithm provides advantages in performance.
High-level aftereffects to global scene properties.,2010-Dec,"Michelle R Greene, Aude Oliva","Adaptation is ubiquitous in the human visual system, allowing recalibration to the statistical regularities of its input. Previous work has shown that global scene properties such as openness and mean depth are informative dimensions of natural scene variation useful for human and machine scene categorization (Greene & Oliva, 2009b; Oliva & Torralba, 2001). A visual system that rapidly categorizes scenes using such statistical regularities should be continuously updated, and therefore is prone to adaptation along these dimensions. Using a rapid serial visual presentation paradigm, we show aftereffects to several global scene properties (magnitude 8-21%). In addition, aftereffects were preserved when the test image was presented 10 degrees away from the adapted location, suggesting that the origin of these aftereffects is not solely due to low-level adaptation. We show systematic modulation of observers' basic-level scene categorization performances after adapting to a global property, suggesting a strong representational role of global properties in rapid scene categorization."
Monitoring urban black-odorous water by using hyperspectral data and machine learning.,2021-Jan-15,"Ji Yang, Alicia Zhou, Liusheng Han, Yong Li, Yichun Xie","Economic development, population growth, industrialization, and urbanization dramatically increase urban water quality deterioration, and thereby endanger human life and health. However, there are not many efficient methods and techniques to monitor urban black and odorous water (BOW) pollution. Our research aims at identifying primary indicators of urban BOW through their spectral characteristics and differentiation. This research combined ground in-situ water quality data with ground hyperspectral data collected from main urban BOWs in Guangzhou, China, and integrated factorial data mining and machine learning techniques to investigate how to monitor urban BOW. Eight key water quality parameters at 52 sample sites were used to retrieve three latent dimensions of urban BOW quality by factorial data mining. The synchronically measured hyperspectral bands along with the band combinations were examined by the machine learning technique, Lasso regression, to identify the most correlated bands and band combinations, over which three multiple regression models were fitted against three latent water quality indicators to determine which spectral bands were highly sensitive to three dimensions of urban BOW pollution. The findings revealed that the many sensitive bands were concentrated in higher hyperspectral band ranges, which supported the unique contribution of hyperspectral data for monitoring water quality. In addition, this integrated data mining and machine learning approach overcame the limitations of conventional band selection, which focus on a limited number of band ratios, band differences, and reflectance bands in the lower range of infrared region. The outcome also indicated that the integration of dimensionality reduction with feature selection shows good potential for monitoring urban BOW. This new analysis framework can be used in urban BOW monitoring and provides scientific data for policymakers to monitor it."
Disaster and Pandemic Management Using Machine Learning: A Survey.,2021-Nov-01,"Vinay Chamola, Vikas Hassija, Sakshi Gupta, Adit Goyal, Mohsen Guizani, Biplab Sikdar","This article provides a literature review of state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms for disaster and pandemic management. Most nations are concerned about disasters and pandemics, which, in general, are highly unlikely events. To date, various technologies, such as IoT, object sensing, UAV, 5G, and cellular networks, smartphone-based system, and satellite-based systems have been used for disaster and pandemic management. ML algorithms can handle multidimensional, large volumes of data that occur naturally in environments related to disaster and pandemic management and are particularly well suited for important related tasks, such as recognition and classification. ML algorithms are useful for predicting disasters and assisting in disaster management tasks, such as determining crowd evacuation routes, analyzing social media posts, and handling the post-disaster situation. ML algorithms also find great application in pandemic management scenarios, such as predicting pandemics, monitoring pandemic spread, disease diagnosis, etc. This article first presents a tutorial on ML algorithms. It then presents a detailed review of several ML algorithms and how we can combine these algorithms with other technologies to address disaster and pandemic management. It also discusses various challenges, open issues and, directions for future research."
Classification of premalignant pancreatic cancer mass-spectrometry data using decision tree ensembles.,2008-Jun-11,"Guangtao Ge, G William Wong","Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Consequently, identification of clinically relevant biomarkers for the early detection of this cancer type is urgently needed. In recent years, proteomics profiling techniques combined with various data analysis methods have been successfully used to gain critical insights into processes and mechanisms underlying pathologic conditions, particularly as they relate to cancer. However, the high dimensionality of proteomics data combined with their relatively small sample sizes poses a significant challenge to current data mining methodology where many of the standard methods cannot be applied directly. Here, we propose a novel methodological framework using machine learning method, in which decision tree based classifier ensembles coupled with feature selection methods, is applied to proteomics data generated from premalignant pancreatic cancer."
Leading determinants for multimorbidity in middle-aged Australian men and women: A nine-year follow-up cohort study.,2020-Dec,"Xianwen Shang, Wei Peng, Jinrong Wu, Mingguang He, Lei Zhang","Although socioeconomic, behavioural, psychological, and biological factors have been individually linked to multimorbidity, data on the importance of these factors are limited. Our study aimed to determine the leading predictors for multimorbidity of chronic conditions in middle-aged Australian adults using machine learning methods. We included 53,867 participants aged 45-64 years from the 45 and Up Study who were free of eleven predefined chronic conditions at baseline (2006-2009) in the analysis. Incident multimorbidity was defined by the co-existence of ≥2, ≥3, or ≥ 4 conditions during follow-up until December 31, 2016. The five leading predictors for multimorbidity in men were age (7.2-20.5% of total variance), body mass index (6.5-15.4%), smoking (4.0-8.3%), chicken intake (3.6-7.5%), and red meat intake (4.6-6.3%) across the three definitions. Leading predictors varied across the three definitions in women, but the four common ones were body mass index (6.3-20.1%), age (6.2-16.4%), chicken intake (4.1-8.3%), and red meat intake (4.2-4.7%). The ten leading modifiable health factors accounted for 39.4-46.1% of total variance across the three definitions. Men with 6-10 health factors had 46-54% lower risks for multimorbidity compared with those reporting ≤2. The corresponding percentage for women was 45-52%. Non-behavioural factors including psychological distress, low education and income and high relative economic disadvantage were among the leading risk factors for multimorbidity. In conclusion, modifications on behavioural factors including diets, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption may reduce the risk of multimorbidity in middle-aged adults, whereas individuals with low socioeconomic status or psychological distress are at the highest priority for intervention."
The Use of Explainable Machine Learning for the Prediction of the Quality of Bulk-Tank Milk in Sheep and Goat Farms.,2024-Dec-12,"Daphne T Lianou, Yiannis Kiouvrekis, Charalambia K Michael, Natalia G C Vasileiou, Ioannis Psomadakis, Antonis P Politis, Angeliki I Katsafadou, Eleni I Katsarou, Maria V Bourganou, Dimitra V Liagka, Dimitrios C Chatzopoulos, Nikolaos M Solomakos, George C Fthenakis","The specific objective of the present study was to develop computational models, by means of which predictions could be performed regarding the quality of the bulk-tank milk in dairy sheep and goat farms. Our hypothesis was that use of specific variables related to the health management applied in the farm can facilitate the development of predictions regarding values related to milk quality, specifically for fat content, protein content, fat and protein content combined, somatic cell counts, and total bacterial counts. Bulk-tank milk from 325 sheep and 119 goat farms was collected and evaluated by established techniques for analysis of fat and protein content, for somatic cell counting, and for total bacterial counting. Subsequently, computational models were constructed for the prediction of five target values: (a) fat content, (b) protein content, (c) fat and protein, (d) somatic cell counts, and (e) total bacterial counts, through the use of 21 independent variables related to factors prevalent in the farm. Five machine learning tools were employed: decision trees (18 different models evaluated), random forests (16 models), XGBoost (240 models), k-nearest neighbours (72 models), and neural networks (576 models) (in total, 9220 evaluations were performed). Tools found with the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the five tools used to test predictions for each target value were selected. In sheep farms, for the prediction of protein content, k-nearest neighbours was selected (MAPE: 3.95%); for the prediction of fat and protein content combined, neural networks was selected (6.00%); and for the prediction of somatic cell counts, random forests and k-nearest neighbours were selected (6.55%); no tool provided useful predictions for fat content and for total bacterial counts. In goat farms, for the prediction of protein content, k-nearest neighbours was selected (MAPE: 6.17%); for the prediction of somatic cell counts, random forests and k-nearest neighbours were selected (4.93% and 5.00%); and for the prediction of total bacterial counts, neural networks was selected (8.33%); no tool provided useful prediction models for fat content and for fat and protein content combined. The results of the study will be of interest to farmers, as well as to professionals; the findings will also be useful to dairy processing factories. That way, it will be possible to obtain a distance-aware, rapid, quantitative estimation of the milk output from sheep and goat farms with sufficient data attributes. It will thus become easier to monitor and improve milk quality at the farm level as part of the dairy production chain. Moreover, the findings can support the setup of relevant and appropriate measures and interventions in dairy sheep and goat farms."

"Association of TLR4 (D299G, T399I), TLR9 -1486T>C, TIRAP S180L and TNF-α promoter (-1031, -863, -857) polymorphisms with risk for systemic lupus erythematosus among South Indians.",2015-Jan,"Y Rupasree, S M Naushad, L Rajasekhar, A Uma, V K Kutala","The rationale of this case-control study was to explore the association of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) D299G, TLR4 T399I, TLR9 -1486 T>C, TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP) S180 L and tumor necrosis-α (TNF-α) promoter polymorphisms with susceptibility and phenotypic heterogeneity of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). PCR-RFLP, real-time PCR was used for the genetic analysis and expression studies and ELISA was used for the determination of specific autoantibodies. TLR4 D299G was associated with the risk for SLE (OR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.08-2.28), while the TNF-α (-1031, -863, -857) CCC haplotype conferred protection. TLR4 and TIRAP polymorphisms were associated with reduced expression of HLA-DR. The presence of TLR4 and TLR9 polymorphisms increases the MHC2TA expression, while TIRAP polymorphism was associated with reduced expression. TLR4 D299 G showed an inverse association with pulmonary hypertension. TLR 4 T399I and TLR9 -1486 T>C showed a positive association with seizures and photosensitivity, respectively. TIRAP S180 L showed a positive association with alopecia and malar rashes, while an inverse association with psychosis was observed. TLR4 T399I (r = 0.14, p = 0.05) and TIRAP S180 L (r = 0.15, p = 0.03) showed a positive association with anti-Ro antibodies. On the other hand, TLR9 -1486 T>C showed an inverse association with anti-La antibodies (r = -0.20, p = 0.006). To conclude, TLR4 D299G increases the risk for SLE, while TNF-α CCC haplotype reduces the risk for SLE. All these polymorphisms contribute toward phenotypic heterogeneity. TLR4 T399I, TLR9 -1486 T>C and TIRAP S180 L influence specific autoantibody production in SLE."
Prediction and interpretation of antibiotic-resistance genes occurrence at recreational beaches using machine learning models.,2023-Feb-15,"Sara Iftikhar, Asad Mustafa Karim, Aoun Murtaza Karim, Mujahid Aizaz Karim, Muhammad Aslam, Fazila Rubab, Sumera Kausar Malik, Jeong Eun Kwon, Imran Hussain, Esam I Azhar, Se Chan Kang, Muhammad Yasir","Antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are pollutants of worldwide concern that seriously threaten public health and ecosystems. Machine learning (ML) prediction models have been applied to predict ARGs in beach waters. However, the existing studies were conducted at a single location and had low prediction performance. Moreover, ML models are ""black boxes"" that do not reveal their predictions' internal nuances and mechanisms. This lack of transparency and trust can result in serious consequences when using these models in high-stakes decisions. In this study, we developed a gradient boosted regression tree based (GBRT) ML model and then described its behavior using six explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model-agnostic explanation methods. We used hydro-meteorological and qPCR data from the beaches in South Korea and Pakistan and developed ML prediction models for aac (6'-lb-cr), sul1, and tetX with 10-fold time-blocked cross-validation performances of 4.9, 2.06 and 4.4 root mean squared logarithmic error, respectively. We then analyzed the local and global behavior of the developed ML model using four interpretation methods. The developed ML models showed that water temperature, precipitation and tide are the most important predictors for prediction of ARGs at recreational beaches. We show that the model-agnostic interpretation methods not only explain the behavior of the ML model but also provide insights into the behavior of the ML model under new unseen conditions. Moreover, these post-processing techniques can be a debugging tool for ML-based modeling."

EDLaaS:Fully Homomorphic Encryption over Neural Network Graphs for Vision and Private Strawberry Yield Forecasting.,2022-Oct-24,"George Onoufriou, Marc Hanheide, Georgios Leontidis","We present automatically parameterised Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) for encrypted neural network inference and exemplify our inference over FHE-compatible neural networks with our own open-source framework and reproducible examples. We use the fourth generation Cheon, Kim, Kim, and Song (CKKS) FHE scheme over fixed points provided by the Microsoft Simple Encrypted Arithmetic Library (MS-SEAL). We significantly enhance the usability and applicability of FHE in deep learning contexts, with a focus on the constituent graphs, traversal, and optimisation. We find that FHE is not a panacea for all privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) problems and that certain limitations still remain, such as model training. However, we also find that in certain contexts FHE is well-suited for computing completely private predictions with neural networks. The ability to privately compute sensitive problems more easily while lowering the barriers to entry can allow otherwise too-sensitive fields to begin advantaging themselves of performant third-party neural networks. Lastly, we show how encrypted deep learning can be applied to a sensitive real-world problem in agri-food, i.e., strawberry yield forecasting, demonstrating competitive performance. We argue that the adoption of encrypted deep learning methods at scale could allow for a greater adoption of deep learning methodologies where privacy concerns exist, hence having a large positive potential impact within the agri-food sector and its journey to net zero."

Image processing and supervised machine learning for retinal microglia characterization in senescence.,2024,"Soyoung Choi, Daniel Hill, Jonathan Young, Maria Francesca Cordeiro","The process of senescence impairs the function of cells and can ultimately be a key factor in the development of disease. With an aging population, senescence-related diseases are increasing in prevalence. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of cellular senescence within the central nervous system (CNS), including the retina, may yield new therapeutic pathways to slow or even prevent the development of neuro- and retinal degenerative diseases. One method of probing the changing functions of senescent retinal cells is to observe retinal microglial cells. Their morphological structure may change in response to their surrounding cellular environment. In this chapter, we show how microglial cells in the retina, which are implicated in aging and diseases of the CNS, can be identified, quantified, and classified into five distinct morphotypes using image processing and supervised machine learning algorithms. The process involves dissecting, staining, and mounting mouse retinas, before image capture via fluorescence microscopy. The resulting images can then be classified by morphotype using a support vector machine (SVM) we have recently described showing high accuracy. This SVM model uses shape metrics found to correspond with qualitative descriptions of the shape of each morphotype taken from existing literature. We encourage more objective and widespread use of methods of quantification such as this. We believe automatic delineation of the population of microglial cells in the retina, could potentially lead to their use as retinal imaging biomarkers for disease prediction in the future."
ADA-Tucker: Compressing deep neural networks via adaptive dimension adjustment tucker decomposition.,2019-Feb,"Zhisheng Zhong, Fangyin Wei, Zhouchen Lin, Chao Zhang","Despite recent success of deep learning models in numerous applications, their widespread use on mobile devices is seriously impeded by storage and computational requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel network compression method called Adaptive Dimension Adjustment Tucker decomposition (ADA-Tucker). With learnable core tensors and transformation matrices, ADA-Tucker performs Tucker decomposition of arbitrary-order tensors. Furthermore, we propose that weight tensors in networks with proper order and balanced dimension are easier to be compressed. Therefore, the high flexibility in decomposition choice distinguishes ADA-Tucker from all previous low-rank models. To compress more, we further extend the model to Shared Core ADA-Tucker (SCADA-Tucker) by defining a shared core tensor for all layers. Our methods require no overhead of recording indices of non-zero elements. Without loss of accuracy, our methods reduce the storage of LeNet-5 and LeNet-300 by ratios of 691× and 233 ×, respectively, significantly outperforming state of the art. The effectiveness of our methods is also evaluated on other three benchmarks (CIFAR-10, SVHN, ILSVRC12) and modern newly deep networks (ResNet, Wide-ResNet)."

Ribosome profiling reveals resemblance between long non-coding RNAs and 5' leaders of coding RNAs.,2013-Jul,"Guo-Liang Chew, Andrea Pauli, John L Rinn, Aviv Regev, Alexander F Schier, Eivind Valen","Large-scale genomics and computational approaches have identified thousands of putative long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). It has been controversial, however, as to what fraction of these RNAs is truly non-coding. Here, we combine ribosome profiling with a machine-learning approach to validate lncRNAs during zebrafish development in a high throughput manner. We find that dozens of proposed lncRNAs are protein-coding contaminants and that many lncRNAs have ribosome profiles that resemble the 5' leaders of coding RNAs. Analysis of ribosome profiling data from embryonic stem cells reveals similar properties for mammalian lncRNAs. These results clarify the annotation of developmental lncRNAs and suggest a potential role for translation in lncRNA regulation. In addition, our computational pipeline and ribosome profiling data provide a powerful resource for the identification of translated open reading frames during zebrafish development."

Gene expression inference with deep learning.,2016-Jun-15,"Yifei Chen, Yi Li, Rajiv Narayan, Aravind Subramanian, Xiaohui Xie","Large-scale gene expression profiling has been widely used to characterize cellular states in response to various disease conditions, genetic perturbations, etc. Although the cost of whole-genome expression profiles has been dropping steadily, generating a compendium of expression profiling over thousands of samples is still very expensive. Recognizing that gene expressions are often highly correlated, researchers from the NIH LINCS program have developed a cost-effective strategy of profiling only ∼1000 carefully selected landmark genes and relying on computational methods to infer the expression of remaining target genes. However, the computational approach adopted by the LINCS program is currently based on linear regression (LR), limiting its accuracy since it does not capture complex nonlinear relationship between expressions of genes."
Intelligent personalized shopping recommendation using clustering and supervised machine learning algorithms.,2022,"Nail Chabane, Achraf Bouaoune, Reda Tighilt, Moloud Abdar, Alix Boc, Etienne Lord, Nadia Tahiri, Bogdan Mazoure, U Rajendra Acharya, Vladimir Makarenkov","Next basket recommendation is a critical task in market basket data analysis. It is particularly important in grocery shopping, where grocery lists are an essential part of shopping habits of many customers. In this work, we first present a new grocery Recommender System available on the MyGroceryTour platform. Our online system uses different traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, and provides recommendations to users in a real-time manner. It aims to help Canadian customers create their personalized intelligent weekly grocery lists based on their individual purchase histories, weekly specials offered in local stores, and product cost and availability information. We perform clustering analysis to partition given customer profiles into four non-overlapping clusters according to their grocery shopping habits. Then, we conduct computational experiments to compare several traditional ML algorithms and our new DL algorithm based on the use of a gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. Our DL algorithm can be viewed as an extension of DREAM (Dynamic REcurrent bAsket Model) adapted to multi-class (i.e. multi-store) classification, since a given user can purchase recommended products in different grocery stores in which these products are available. Among traditional ML algorithms, the highest average F-score of 0.516 for the considered data set of 831 customers was obtained using Random Forest, whereas our proposed DL algorithm yielded the average F-score of 0.559 for this data set. The main advantage of the presented Recommender System is that our intelligent recommendation is personalized, since a separate traditional ML or DL model is built for each customer considered. Such a personalized approach allows us to outperform the prediction results provided by general state-of-the-art DL models."

Gateway Selection in Millimeter Wave UAV Wireless Networks Using Multi-Player Multi-Armed Bandit.,2020-Jul-16,"Ehab Mahmoud Mohamed, Sherief Hashima, Abdallah Aldosary, Kohei Hatano, Mahmoud Ahmed Abdelghany","Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based communications gained a lot of attention due to their numerous applications, especially in rescue services in post-disaster areas where the terrestrial network is wholly malfunctioned. Multiple access/gateway UAVs are distributed to fully cover the post-disaster area as flying base stations to provide communication coverage, collect valuable information, disseminate essential instructions, etc. The access UAVs after gathering/broadcasting the necessary information should select and fly towards one of the surrounding gateways for relaying their information. In this paper, the gateway UAV selection problem is addressed. The main aim is to maximize the long-term average data rates of the UAVs relays while minimizing the flights' battery cost, where millimeter wave links, i.e., using 30~300 GHz band, employing antenna beamforming, are used for backhauling. A tool of machine learning (ML) is exploited to address the problem as a budget-constrained multi-player multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. In this setup, access UAVs act as the players, and the arms are the gateway UAVs, while the rewards are the average data rates of the constructed relays constrained by the battery cost of the access UAV flights. In this decentralized setting, where information is neither prior available nor exchanged among UAVs, a selfish and concurrent multi-player MAB strategy is suggested. Towards this end, three battery-aware MAB (BA-MAB) algorithms, namely upper confidence bound (UCB), Thompson sampling (TS), and the exponential weight algorithm for exploration and exploitation (EXP3), are proposed to realize gateways selection efficiently. The proposed BA-MAB-based gateway UAV selection algorithms show superior performance over approaches based on near and random selections in terms of total system rate and energy efficiency."
"Mapping the NFT revolution: market trends, trade networks, and visual features.",2021-Oct-22,"Matthieu Nadini, Laura Alessandretti, Flavio Di Giacinto, Mauro Martino, Luca Maria Aiello, Andrea Baronchelli","Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that represent objects like art, collectible, and in-game items. They are traded online, often with cryptocurrency, and are generally encoded within smart contracts on a blockchain. Public attention towards NFTs has exploded in 2021, when their market has experienced record sales, but little is known about the overall structure and evolution of its market. Here, we analyse data concerning 6.1 million trades of 4.7 million NFTs between June 23, 2017 and April 27, 2021, obtained primarily from Ethereum and WAX blockchains. First, we characterize statistical properties of the market. Second, we build the network of interactions, show that traders typically specialize on NFTs associated with similar objects and form tight clusters with other traders that exchange the same kind of objects. Third, we cluster objects associated to NFTs according to their visual features and show that collections contain visually homogeneous objects. Finally, we investigate the predictability of NFT sales using simple machine learning algorithms and find that sale history and, secondarily, visual features are good predictors for price. We anticipate that these findings will stimulate further research on NFT production, adoption, and trading in different contexts."

To prevent frailty, we need a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms and early detection of individuals at risk. Both may be served by identifying candidate (bio)markers, i.e. biomarkers and markers, for the physical, cognitive, and psychological frailty domains. We used univariate (Rank-ANOVA) and multivariate (elastic net) approaches on the RASIG study population (age range: 35-74 years, n = 2220) of the MARK-AGE study to study up to 331 (bio)markers between individuals with and without frailty for each domain. Biomarkers and markers identified by both approaches were studied further regarding their association with frailty using logistic regression. Univariately, we found lower levels of antioxidants, including β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin, in those who were physically, cognitively or psychologically frail. Additionally, self-reported health was worse in these three frail groups. Multivariately, we observed lower levels of β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin in the cognitively frail. Levels of these carotenoids were inversely associated with the risk of being cognitively frail after adjusting for confounders. Antioxidants and self-reported health are potential (bio)markers to detect persons at risk of becoming frail. The biomarkers identified may indicate the involvement of inflammation in frailty, especially for physical and cognitive frailty."
Wrapper method for feature selection to classify cardiac arrhythmia.,2017-Jul,"Anam Mustaqeem, Syed Muhammad Anwar, Muhammad Majid, Abdul Rashid Khan","Efficient monitoring of cardiac patients can save tremendous amount of lives. Cardiac disease prediction and classification has gained utmost significance in this regard during the past few years. This paper presents a predictive model for classification of arrhythmias. The model works by selecting best features using wrapper algorithm around random forest, followed by implementing various machine learning classifiers on the selected features. Cardiac arrhythmia dataset from University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository has been used for the experimental purpose. After normalizing the data, repeated cross validation with 10 folds is applied on support vector machine (SVM), K nearest neighbor (KNN), Naïve Bayes, random forest, and Multi-Layer perceptron (MLP). The experimental results demonstrate that MLP beats other classifiers by achieving an average accuracy of 78.26%, while accuracies calculated for KNN and SVM are 76.6% and 74.4% respectively, outperforming the accuracies of previous models."

Most approaches in the literature have focused either on finding a few strong regulatory patterns or on learning descriptive models from training data. However, these approaches are not yet adequate for making accurate predictions about which genes will be up- or down-regulated in new or held-out experiments. By introducing a predictive methodology for this problem, we can use powerful tools from machine learning and assess the statistical significance of our predictions."
Mouse tissue glycome atlas 2022 highlights inter-organ variation in major N-glycan profiles.,2022-Oct-24,"Michiru Otaki, Nozomi Hirane, Yayoi Natsume-Kitatani, Mari Nogami Itoh, Masanori Shindo, Yoichi Kurebayashi, Shin-Ichiro Nishimura","This study presents ""mouse tissue glycome atlas"" representing the profiles of major N-glycans of mouse glycoproteins that may define their essential functions in the surface glycocalyx of mouse organs/tissues and serum-derived extracellular vesicles (exosomes). Cell surface glycocalyx composed of a variety of N-glycans attached covalently to the membrane proteins, notably characteristic ""N-glycosylation patterns"" of the glycocalyx, plays a critical role for the regulation of cell differentiation, cell adhesion, homeostatic immune response, and biodistribution of secreted exosomes. Given that the integrity of cell surface glycocalyx correlates significantly with maintenance of the cellular morphology and homeostatic immune functions, dynamic alterations of N-glycosylation patterns in the normal glycocalyx caused by cellular abnormalities may serve as highly sensitive and promising biomarkers. Although it is believed that inter-organs variations in N-glycosylation patterns exist, information of the glycan diversity in mouse organs/tissues remains to be elusive. Here we communicate for the first-time N-glycosylation patterns of 16 mouse organs/tissues, serum, and serum-derived exosomes of Slc:ddY mice using an established solid-phase glycoblotting platform for the rapid, easy, and high throughput MALDI-TOFMS-based quantitative glycomics. The present results elicited occurrence of the organ/tissue-characteristic N-glycosylation patterns that can be discriminated to each other. Basic machine learning analysis using this N-glycome dataset enabled classification between 16 mouse organs/tissues with the highest F1 score (69.7-100%) when neural network algorithm was used. A preliminary examination demonstrated that machine learning analysis of mouse lung N-glycome dataset by random forest algorithm allows for the discrimination of lungs among the different mouse strains such as the outbred mouse Slc:ddY, inbred mouse DBA/2Crslc, and systemic lupus erythematosus model mouse MRL-lpr/lpr with the highest F1 score (74.5-83.8%). Our results strongly implicate importance of ""human organ/tissue glycome atlas"" for understanding the crucial and diversified roles of glycocalyx determined by the organ/tissue-characteristic N-glycosylation patterns and the discovery research for N-glycome-based disease-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets."

A multi-feature deep learning system to enhance glaucoma severity diagnosis with high accuracy and fast speed.,2022-Dec,"Ying Xue, Jiazhu Zhu, Xiaoling Huang, Xiaobin Xu, Xiaojing Li, Yameng Zheng, Zhijing Zhu, Kai Jin, Juan Ye, Wei Gong, Ke Si","Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness, and the early detection and timely treatment are essential for glaucoma management. However, due to the interindividual variability in the characteristics of glaucoma onset, a single feature is not yet sufficient for monitoring glaucoma progression in isolation. There is an urgent need to develop more comprehensive diagnostic methods with higher accuracy. In this study, we proposed a multi- feature deep learning (MFDL) system based on intraocular pressure (IOP), color fundus photograph (CFP) and visual field (VF) to classify the glaucoma into four severity levels. We designed a three-phase framework for glaucoma severity diagnosis from coarse to fine, which contains screening, detection and classification. We trained it on 6,131 samples from 3,324 patients and tested it on independent 240 samples from 185 patients. Our results show that MFDL achieved a higher accuracy of 0.842 (95 % CI, 0.795-0.888) than the direct four classification deep learning (DFC-DL, accuracy of 0.513 [0.449-0.576]), CFP-based single-feature deep learning (CFP-DL, accuracy of 0.483 [0.420-0.547]) and VF-based single-feature deep learning (VF-DL, accuracy of 0.725 [0.668-0.782]). Its performance was statistically significantly superior to that of 8 juniors. It also outperformed 3 seniors and 1 expert, and was comparable with 2 glaucoma experts (0.842 vs 0.854, p = 0.663; 0.842 vs 0.858, p = 0.580). With the assistance of MFDL, junior ophthalmologists achieved statistically significantly higher accuracy performance, with the increased accuracy ranged from 7.50 % to 17.9 %, and that of seniors and experts were 6.30 % to 7.50 % and 5.40 % to 7.50 %. The mean diagnosis time per patient of MFDL was 5.96 s. The proposed model can potentially assist ophthalmologists in efficient and accurate glaucoma diagnosis that could aid the clinical management of glaucoma."

We hypothesize that integrating clinical knowledge with machine learning can facilitate effective development and maintenance of order sets while promoting best practices in ordering. To this end, we simulated the revision of an ""AM Lab Order Set"" under 6 revision approaches. Revisions included changes in the order set content or default settings through 1) population statistics, 2) individualized prediction using machine learning, and 3) clinical knowledge. Revision criteria were determined using electronic health record (EHR) data from 2014 to 2015. Each revision's clinical appropriateness, workload from using the order set, and generalizability across time were evaluated using EHR data from 2016 and 2017. Our results suggest a potential order set revision approach that jointly leverages clinical knowledge and machine learning to improve usability while updating contents based on latest clinical knowledge and best practices."
Design and performance analysis of multi-enzyme activity-doped nanozymes assisted by machine learning.,2025-Apr,"Fuguo Ge, Yonghui Gao, Yujie Jiang, Yijie Yu, Qiang Bai, Yun Liu, HuiBin Li, Ning Sui","Traditional design approaches for nanozymes typically rely on empirical methods and trial-and-error, which hampers systematic optimization of their structure and performance, thus limiting the efficiency of developing innovative nanozymes. This study leverages machine learning techniques supported by high-throughput computations to effectively design nanozymes with multi-enzyme activities and to elucidate their reaction mechanisms. Additionally, it investigates the impact of dopants on the microphysical properties of nanozymes. We constructed a machine learning prediction framework tailored for dopant nanozymes exhibiting catalytic activities like to oxidase (OXD) and peroxidase (POD). This framework was used to evaluate key catalytic performance parameters, such as formation energy, density of states (DOS), and adsorption energy, through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Various machine learning models were employed to predict the effects of different doping element ratios on the catalytic activity and stability of nanozymes. The results indicate that the combination of machine learning with high-throughput computations significantly accelerates the design and optimization of dopant nanozymes, providing an efficient strategy to address the complexities of nanozyme design. This approach not only boosts the efficiency and capability for innovation in material design but also provides a novel theoretical analytical avenue for the development of new functional materials."

Radiomics in surgical oncology: applications and challenges.,2021-Dec,"Travis L Williams, Lily V Saadat, Mithat Gonen, Alice Wei, Richard K G Do, Amber L Simpson","Surgery is a curative treatment option for many patients with malignant tumors. Increased attention has focused on the combination of surgery with chemotherapy, as multimodality treatment has been associated with promising results in certain cancer types. Despite these data, there remains clinical equipoise on optimal timing and patient selection for neoadjuvant or adjuvant strategies. Radiomics, an emerging field involving the extraction of advanced features from radiographic images, has the potential to revolutionize oncologic treatment and contribute to the advance of personalized therapy by helping predict tumor behavior and response to therapy. This review analyzes and summarizes studies that use radiomics with machine learning in patients who have received neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy to predict prognosis, recurrence, survival, and therapeutic response for various cancer types. While studies in both neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings demonstrate above average performance on ability to predict progression-free and overall survival, there remain many challenges and limitations to widespread implementation of this technology. The lack of standardization of common practices to analyze radiomics, limited data sharing, and absence of auto-segmentation have hindered the inclusion and rapid adoption of radiomics in prospective, clinical studies."

A systematic review of machine learning applications in predicting opioid associated adverse events.,2025-Jan-16,"Carlos R Ramírez Medina, Jose Benitez-Aurioles, David A Jenkins, Meghna Jani","Machine learning has increasingly been applied to predict opioid-related harms due to its ability to handle complex interactions and generating actionable predictions. This review evaluated the types and quality of ML methods in opioid safety research, identifying 44 studies using supervised ML through searches of Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed and SCOPUS databases. Commonly predicted outcomes included postoperative opioid use (n = 15, 34%) opioid overdose (n = 8, 18%), opioid use disorder (n = 8, 18%) and persistent opioid use (n = 5, 11%) with varying definitions. Most studies (96%) originated from North America, with only 7% reporting external validation. Model performance was moderate to strong, but calibration was often missing (41%). Transparent reporting of model development was often incomplete, with key aspects such as calibration, imbalance correction, and handling of missing data absent. Infrequent external validation limited the generalizability of current models. Addressing these aspects is critical for transparency, interpretability, and future implementation of the results."
Medical Doctors' Perceptions of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Healthcare.,2024-Sep,"Arijita Banerjee, Pradosh Kumar Sarangi, Sumit Kumar","Introduction With the current exponential expansion of robotics, implants, and imaging technologies, diagnostic processes within the healthcare industry are becoming popular platforms for artificial intelligence (AI) use. Thus, an understanding of physicians' attitudes toward AI and the extent to which medical educators are ready to work with AI is necessary. This research aimed to study doctors' perceptions of AI in healthcare. Methods A web-based questionnaire organized into four sections, namely, demographics, concepts of AI, education in AI, and implementation challenges related to AI, was designed systematically based on a literature search and circulated among medical doctors from various fields. Results Study participants exhibited a lower score toward familiarity with AI. Only 52.12% (74/142) of physicians completed the survey. The greatest challenge associated with the use of AI in therapeutic settings was found to be the degree of autonomy, with a score of 3.56. Among the participants, 67.61% felt that the lack of human supervision was the most important limiting factor in the implementation of AI in clinical practice. However, the participants demonstrated a strong interest in understanding the concepts of AI in the near future. Conclusion This study revealed a low degree of familiarity with AI, highlighting the need for medical schools and hospitals to establish specialized education and training programs for physicians to improve patient outcomes."
Rotation Awareness Based Self-Supervised Learning for SAR Target Recognition With Limited Training Samples.,2021,"Zaidao Wen, Zhunga Liu, Shuai Zhang, Quan Pan","The scattering signatures of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) target image will be highly sensitive to different azimuth angles/poses, which aggravates the demand for training samples in learning-based SAR image automatic target recognition (ATR) algorithms, and makes SAR ATR a more challenging task. This paper develops a novel rotation awareness-based learning framework termed RotANet for SAR ATR under the condition of limited training samples. First, we propose an encoding scheme to characterize the rotational pattern of pose variations among intra-class targets. These targets will constitute several ordered sequences with different rotational patterns via permutations. By further exploiting the intrinsic relation constraints among these sequences as the supervision, we develop a novel self-supervised task which makes RotANet learn to predict the rotational pattern of a baseline sequence and then autonomously generalize this ability to the others without external supervision. Therefore, this task essentially contains a learning and self-validation process to achieve human-like rotation awareness, and it serves as a task-induced prior to regularize the learned feature domain of RotANet in conjunction with an individual target recognition task to improve the generalization ability of the features. Extensive experiments on moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition benchmark database demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Compared with other state-of-the-art SAR ATR algorithms, RotANet will remarkably improve the recognition accuracy especially in the case of very limited training samples without performing any other data augmentation strategy."
Computer aided analysis of epi-illumination and transillumination images of skin lesions for diagnosis of skin cancers.,2011,"Brian D'Alessandro, Atam P Dhawan, Nizar Mullani","Skin lesion pigmentation area from surface, or, epi-illumination (ELM) images and blood volume area from transillumination (TLM) images are useful features to aid a dermatologist in the diagnosis of melanoma and other skin cancers in early curable stages. However, segmentation of these areas is difficult. In this work, we present an automatic segmentation tool for ELM and TLM images that also provides additional choices for user selection and interaction with adaptive learning. Our tool uses a combination of k-means clustering, wavelet analysis, and morphological operations to segment the lesion and blood volume, and then presents the user with six segmentation suggestions for both ELM and TLM images. The final selection of segmentation boundary may then be iteratively improved through scoring by multiple users. The ratio of TLM to ELM segmented areas is an indicator of dysplasia in skin lesions for detection of skin cancers, and this ratio is found to show a statistically significant trend in association with lesion dysplasia on a set of 81 pathologically validated lesions (p = 0.0058). We then present a support vector machine classifier using the results from the interactive segmentation method along with ratio, color, texture, and shape features to characterize skin lesions into three degrees of dysplasia with promising accuracy."

In this commentary, our objectives are twofold: (1) to underscore the conceptual challenges of employing User-Avatar Bond for conceptualizing and diagnosing GD risk, and (2) to expound upon what we perceive as a misguided application of supervised machine learning techniques by the authors from a methodological standpoint."
MetAssimulo 2.0: a web app for simulating realistic 1D & 2D Metabolomic 1H NMR spectra.,2025-Jan-25,"Yan Yan, Beatriz Jiménez, Michael T Judge, Toby Athersuch, Maria De Iorio, Timothy M D Ebbels","Metabolomics extensively utilizes Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy due to its excellent reproducibility and high throughput. Both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) NMR spectra provide crucial information for metabolite annotation and quantification, yet present complex overlapping patterns which may require sophisticated machine learning algorithms to decipher. Unfortunately, the limited availability of labeled spectra can hamper application of machine learning, especially deep learning algorithms which require large amounts of labelled data. In this context, simulation of spectral data becomes a tractable solution for algorithm development.Here, we introduce MetAssimulo 2.0, a comprehensive upgrade of the MetAssimulo 1.0 metabolomic 1H NMR simulation tool, reimplemented as a Python-based web application. Where MetAssimulo 1.0 only simulated 1D 1H spectra of human urine, MetAssimulo 2.0 expands functionality to urine, blood, and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), enhancing the realism of blood spectra by incorporating a broad protein background. This enhancement enables a closer approximation to real blood spectra, achieving a Pearson correlation of approximately 0.82. Moreover, this tool now includes simulation capabilities for 2D J-resolved (J-Res) and Correlation Spectroscopy (COSY) spectra, significantly broadening its utility in complex mixture analysis. MetAssimulo 2.0 simulates both single, and groups, of spectra with both discrete (case-control, e.g. heart transplant vs healthy) and continuous (e.g. BMI) outcomes and includes inter-metabolite correlations. It thus supports a range of experimental designs and demonstrating associations between metabolite profiles and biomedical responses.By enhancing NMR spectral simulations, MetAssimulo 2.0 is well positioned to support and enhance research at the intersection of deep learning and metabolomics."
Federated Learning-Based Predictive Traffic Management Using a Contained Privacy-Preserving Scheme for Autonomous Vehicles.,2025-Feb-12,"Tariq Alqubaysi, Abdullah Faiz Al Asmari, Fayez Alanazi, Ahmed Almutairi, Ammar Armghan","Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs) are essential for secure and privacy-preserving communications in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and enhance facilities like connectivity and roadside assistance. Earlier research models used for traffic management compromised user privacy and exposed sensitive data to potential adversaries while handling real-time data from numerous vehicles. This research introduces a Federated Learning-based Predictive Traffic Management (FLPTM) system designed to optimize service access and privacy for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) within an ITS. Moreover, a CPPS will provide strong security to mitigate adversarial threats through state modelling and authenticated access permissions for the integrity of vehicle communication networks from man-in-the-middle attacks. The suggested FLPTM system utilizes a Contained Privacy-Preserving Scheme (CPPS) that decentralizes data processing and allows vehicles to train local models without sharing raw data. The CPPS framework combines a classifier-based learning technique with state modelling and access permissions to protect user data against invasions and man-in-the-middle attacks. The proposed model leverages Federated Learning (FL) to enhance data security in collaborative machine learning processes by allowing updates that preserve privacy, enabling joint learning without exposing raw data. It addresses key challenges such as high communication costs, the impact of adversarial attacks, and access time inefficiencies. Using FL, the model reduces communication costs by 23.29%, mitigates adversarial effects by 16.1%, and improves access time by 18.95%, achieving significant cost savings and maintaining data privacy throughout the learning process."
Discriminative multi-source adaptation multi-feature co-regression for visual classification.,2019-Jun,"Jianwen Tao, Wei Dai","Learning an effective visual classifier from few labeled samples is a challenging problem, which has motivated the multi-source adaptation scheme in machine learning. While the advantages of multi-source adaptation have been widely recognized, there still exit three major limitations in extant methods. Firstly, how to effectively select the discriminative sources is yet an unresolved issue. Secondly, multiple different visual features on hand cannot be effectively exploited to represent a target object for boosting the adaptation performance. Last but not least, they mainly focus on either visual understanding or feature learning independently, which may lead to the so-called semantic gap between the low-level features and the high-level semantics. To overcome these defects, we propose a novel Multi-source Adaptation Multi-Feature (MAMF) co-regression framework by jointly exploring multi-feature co-regression, multiple latent spaces learning, and discriminative sources selection. Concretely, MAMF conducts the multi-feature representation co-regression with feature learning by simultaneously uncovering multiple optimal latent spaces and taking into account correlations among multiple feature representations. Moreover, to discriminatively leverage multi-source knowledge for each target feature representation, MAMF automatically selects the discriminative source models trained on source datasets by formulating it as a row-sparsity pursuit problem. Different from the state-of-the-arts, our method is able to adapt knowledge from multiple sources even if the features of each source and the target are partially different but overlapping. Experimental results on three challenging visual domain adaptation tasks consistently demonstrate the superiority of our method in comparison with the related state-of-the-arts."
Breast Cancer Histopathology Image Classification Using an Ensemble of Deep Learning Models.,2020-Aug-05,"Zabit Hameed, Sofia Zahia, Begonya Garcia-Zapirain, José Javier Aguirre, Ana María Vanegas","Breast cancer is one of the major public health issues and is considered a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Its early diagnosis can effectively help in increasing the chances of survival rate. To this end, biopsy is usually followed as a gold standard approach in which tissues are collected for microscopic analysis. However, the histopathological analysis of breast cancer is non-trivial, labor-intensive, and may lead to a high degree of disagreement among pathologists. Therefore, an automatic diagnostic system could assist pathologists to improve the effectiveness of diagnostic processes. This paper presents an ensemble deep learning approach for the definite classification of non-carcinoma and carcinoma breast cancer histopathology images using our collected dataset. We trained four different models based on pre-trained VGG16 and VGG19 architectures. Initially, we followed 5-fold cross-validation operations on all the individual models, namely, fully-trained VGG16, fine-tuned VGG16, fully-trained VGG19, and fine-tuned VGG19 models. Then, we followed an ensemble strategy by taking the average of predicted probabilities and found that the ensemble of fine-tuned VGG16 and fine-tuned VGG19 performed competitive classification performance, especially on the carcinoma class. The ensemble of fine-tuned VGG16 and VGG19 models offered sensitivity of 97.73% for carcinoma class and overall accuracy of 95.29%. Also, it offered an F1 score of 95.29%. These experimental results demonstrated that our proposed deep learning approach is effective for the automatic classification of complex-natured histopathology images of breast cancer, more specifically for carcinoma images."
Machine Learning in Nanoscience: Big Data at Small Scales.,2020-Jan-08,"Keith A Brown, Sarah Brittman, Nicolò Maccaferri, Deep Jariwala, Umberto Celano","Recent advances in machine learning (ML) offer new tools to extract new insights from large data sets and to acquire small data sets more effectively. Researchers in nanoscience are experimenting with these tools to tackle challenges in many fields. In addition to ML's advancement of nanoscience, nanoscience provides the foundation for neuromorphic computing hardware to expand the implementation of ML algorithms. In this Mini Review, we highlight some recent efforts to connect the ML and nanoscience communities by focusing on three types of interaction: (1) using ML to analyze and extract new insights from large nanoscience data sets, (2) applying ML to accelerate material discovery, including the use of active learning to guide experimental design, and (3) the nanoscience of memristive devices to realize hardware tailored for ML. We conclude with a discussion of challenges and opportunities for future interactions between nanoscience and ML researchers."
Machine learning for exploring neurophysiological functionality in multiple sclerosis based on trigeminal and hand blink reflexes.,2022-Dec-06,"Monica Biggio, Daniele Caligiore, Federico D'Antoni, Marco Bove, Mario Merone","Brainstem dysfunctions are very common in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and are a critical predictive factor for future disability. Brainstem functionality can be explored with blink reflexes, subcortical responses consisting in a blink following a peripheral stimulation. Some reflexes are already employed in clinical practice, such as Trigeminal Blink Reflex (TBR). Here we propose for the first time in MS the exploration of Hand Blink Reflex (HBR), which size is modulated by the proximity of the stimulated hand to the face, reflecting the extension of the peripersonal space. The aim of this work is to test whether Machine Learning (ML) techniques could be used in combination with neurophysiological measurements such as TBR and HBR to improve their clinical information and potentially favour the early detection of brainstem dysfunctionality. HBR and TBR were recorded from a group of People with MS (PwMS) with Relapsing-Remitting form and from a healthy control group. Two AdaBoost classifiers were trained with TBR and HBR features each, for a binary classification task between PwMS and Controls. Both classifiers were able to identify PwMS with an accuracy comparable and even higher than clinicians. Our results indicate that ML techniques could represent a tool for clinicians for investigating brainstem functionality in MS. Also, HBR could be promising when applied in clinical practice, providing additional information about the integrity of brainstem circuits potentially favouring early diagnosis."
Embedding covariate adjustments in tree-based automated machine learning for biomedical big data analyses.,2020-Oct-01,"Elisabetta Manduchi, Weixuan Fu, Joseph D Romano, Stefano Ruberto, Jason H Moore","A typical task in bioinformatics consists of identifying which features are associated with a target outcome of interest and building a predictive model. Automated machine learning (AutoML) systems such as the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) constitute an appealing approach to this end. However, in biomedical data, there are often baseline characteristics of the subjects in a study or batch effects that need to be adjusted for in order to better isolate the effects of the features of interest on the target. Thus, the ability to perform covariate adjustments becomes particularly important for applications of AutoML to biomedical big data analysis."

Automatic glomerular identification and quantification of histological phenotypes using image analysis and machine learning.,2018-Dec-01,"Susan M Sheehan, Ron Korstanje","Current methods of scoring histological kidney samples, specifically glomeruli, do not allow for collection of quantitative data in a high-throughput and consistent manner. Neither untrained individuals nor computers are presently capable of identifying glomerular features, so expert pathologists must do the identification and score using a categorical matrix, complicating statistical analysis. Critical information regarding overall health and physiology is encoded in these samples. Rapid comprehensive histological scoring could be used, in combination with other physiological measures, to significantly advance renal research. Therefore, we used machine learning to develop a high-throughput method to automatically identify and collect quantitative data from glomeruli. Our method requires minimal human interaction between steps and provides quantifiable data independent of user bias. The method uses free existing software and is usable without extensive image analysis training. Validation of the classifier and feature scores in mice is highlighted in this work and shows the power of applying this method in murine research. Preliminary results indicate that the method can be applied to data sets from different species after training on relevant data, allowing for fast glomerular identification and quantitative measurements of glomerular features. Validation of the classifier and feature scores are highlighted in this work and show the power of applying this method. The resulting data are free from user bias. Continuous data, such that statistical analysis can be performed, allows for more precise and comprehensive interrogation of samples. These data can then be combined with other physiological data to broaden our overall understanding of renal function."

Over the past two decades, the BMI community has grown tremendously and reached some impressive milestones, including the first human clinical trials using chronically implanted intracortical electrodes. It has also contributed experimental paradigms and important findings to basic neuroscience. In this review, we discuss neuroscience achievements stemming from BMI research, specifically that based upon upper limb prosthetic control with intracortical microelectrodes. We will focus on three main areas: first, we discuss progress in neural coding of reaches in motor cortex, describing recent results linking high dimensional representations of cortical activity to muscle activation. Next, we describe recent findings on learning and plasticity in motor cortex on various time scales. Finally, we discuss how bidirectional BMIs have led to better understanding of somatosensation in and related to motor cortex."
A machine learning-based clinical predictive tool to identify patients at high risk of medication errors.,2024-Dec-30,"Ammar Abdo, Lyse Gallay, Thibault Vallecillo, Justine Clarenne, Pauline Quillet, Vincent Vuiblet, Rudy Merieux","A medication error is an inadvertent failure in the drug therapy process that can cause serious harm to patients by increasing morbidity and mortality and are associated with significant economic costs to the healthcare system. Medication reconciliation is the most cost-effective intervention and can result in a 66% reduction in medication errors. To improve patient safety, we developed a machine learning-based tool that prioritizes patients at risk of medication errors upon admission to the hospital to ensure that they undergo medication reconciliation by clinical pharmacists. The data were collected from the electronic health records of patients admitted to Reims University Hospital who underwent medication reconciliation between 2017 and 2023. The data from 7200 patients were used to train four machine learning-based models based on 52 variables in the development dataset. These models were used to prioritize admitted patients according to their likelihood of being exposed to a medication error. Our models, particularly the voting classifier model, demonstrated good performance (a recall of 0.75, precision of 0.65, F1 score of 0.70, AUROC of 0.74 and AUCPR of 0.75). In a retrospective evaluation simulating real-life use, the voting classifier model successfully identified 45% of the total patients selected who were found to have at least one unintended discrepancy compared to 21% when using the existing tool. The positive experimental results of this tool showed a superior improvement of 113% over the existing tool by targeting patients at risk of medication errors upon admission to Reims University Hospital."

Spatiotemporal prediction of COVID-19 cases using inter- and intra-county proxies of human interactions.,2021-Nov-08,"Behzad Vahedi, Morteza Karimzadeh, Hamidreza Zoraghein","Measurements of human interaction through proxies such as social connectedness or movement patterns have proved useful for predictive modeling of COVID-19, which is a challenging task, especially at high spatial resolutions. In this study, we develop a Spatiotemporal autoregressive model to predict county-level new cases of COVID-19 in the coterminous US using spatiotemporal lags of infection rates, human interactions, human mobility, and socioeconomic composition of counties as predictive features. We capture human interactions through 1) Facebook- and 2) cell phone-derived measures of connectivity and human mobility, and use them in two separate models for predicting county-level new cases of COVID-19. We evaluate the model on 14 forecast dates between 2020/10/25 and 2021/01/24 over one- to four-week prediction horizons. Comparing our predictions with a Baseline model developed by the COVID-19 Forecast Hub indicates an average 6.46% improvement in prediction Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) over the two-week prediction horizon up to 20.22% improvement in the four-week prediction horizon, pointing to the strong predictive power of our model in the longer prediction horizons."

In this study, we mapped national Mexican forest AGB using satellite remote sensing data and a machine learning approach. We modelled AGB using two scenarios: (1) extensive national forest inventory (NFI), and (2) airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) as reference data. Finally, we propagated uncertainties from field measurements to LiDAR-derived AGB and to the national wall-to-wall forest AGB map."
An Enhanced RIME Optimizer with Horizontal and Vertical Crossover for Discriminating Microseismic and Blasting Signals in Deep Mines.,2023-Oct-28,"Wei Zhu, Zhihui Li, Ali Asghar Heidari, Shuihua Wang, Huiling Chen, Yudong Zhang","Real-time monitoring of rock stability during the mining process is critical. This paper first proposed a RIME algorithm (CCRIME) based on vertical and horizontal crossover search strategies to improve the quality of the solutions obtained by the RIME algorithm and further enhance its search capabilities. Then, by constructing a binary version of CCRIME, the key parameters of FKNN were optimized using a binary conversion method. Finally, a discrete CCRIME-based BCCRIME was developed, which uses an S-shaped function transformation approach to address the feature selection issue by converting the search result into a real number that can only be zero or one. The performance of CCRIME was examined in this study from various perspectives, utilizing 30 benchmark functions from IEEE CEC2017. Basic algorithm comparison tests and sophisticated variant algorithm comparison experiments were also carried out. In addition, this paper also used collected microseismic and blasting data for classification prediction to verify the ability of the BCCRIME-FKNN model to process real data. This paper provides new ideas and methods for real-time monitoring of rock mass stability during deep well mineral resource mining."
Long-range temporal correlations in the brain distinguish conscious wakefulness from induced unconsciousness.,2018-Oct-01,"Thomas Thiery, Tarek Lajnef, Etienne Combrisson, Arthur Dehgan, Pierre Rainville, George A Mashour, Stefanie Blain-Moraes, Karim Jerbi","Rhythmic neuronal synchronization across large-scale networks is thought to play a key role in the regulation of conscious states. Changes in neuronal oscillation amplitude across states of consciousness have been widely reported, but little is known about possible changes in the temporal dynamics of these oscillations. The temporal structure of brain oscillations may provide novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying consciousness. To address this question, we examined long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) of EEG oscillation amplitudes recorded during both wakefulness and anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. Importantly, the time-varying EEG oscillation envelopes were assessed over the course of a sevoflurane sedation protocol during which the participants alternated between states of consciousness and unconsciousness. Both spectral power and LRTC in oscillation amplitude were computed across multiple frequency bands. State-dependent differences in these features were assessed using non-parametric tests and supervised machine learning. We found that periods of unconsciousness were associated with increases in LRTC in beta (15-30Hz) amplitude over frontocentral channels and with a suppression of alpha (8-13Hz) amplitude over occipitoparietal electrodes. Moreover, classifiers trained to predict states of consciousness on single epochs demonstrated that the combination of beta LRTC with alpha amplitude provided the highest classification accuracy (above 80%). These results suggest that loss of consciousness is accompanied by an augmentation of temporal persistence in neuronal oscillation amplitude, which may reflect an increase in regularity and a decrease in network repertoire compared to the brain's activity during resting-state consciousness."
Objective and bias-free measures of candidate motivation during job applications.,2021-Nov-09,"Mitchel Kappen, Marnix Naber","Society suffers from biases and discrimination, a longstanding dilemma that stems from ungrounded, subjective judgments. Especially unequal opportunities in labor remain a persistent challenge, despite the recent inauguration of top-down diplomatic measures.

First, we implemented and developed artificial intelligence, computer vision, and unbiased machine learning software to automatically detect facial muscle activity and emotional expressions to predict the candidates' self-reported motivation levels. The motivation judgments by our model outperformed recruiters' unreliable, invalid, and sometimes biased judgments.

We hypothesized that artificial intelligence-based deep learning (DL) could provide decision support for the toxicologic pathologist by screening for the proliferative changes, verifying the expected pattern for the positive control groups. Whole slide images (WSIs) of the lungs, thymus, and stomach from positive control groups were used for supervised training of a convolutional neural network (CNN). A single pathologist annotated WSIs of normal and abnormal tissue regions for training the CNN-based supervised classifier using INHAND criteria. The algorithm was evaluated using a subset of tissue regions that were not used for training and then additional tissues were evaluated blindly by 2 independent pathologists. A binary output (proliferative classes present or not) from the pathologists was compared to that of the CNN classifier. The CNN model grouped proliferative lesion positive and negative animals at high concordance with the pathologists. This process simulated a workflow for review of these studies, whereby a DL algorithm could provide decision support for the pathologists in a nonclinical study."
Optimizing Autoencoders for Learning Deep Representations From Health Data.,2019-Jan,"Chongyu Zhou, Yao Jia, Mehul Motani","Analyzing patients' health data using machine learning techniques can improve both patient outcomes and hospital operations.

Training-Based Methods for Comparison of Object Detection Methods for Visual Object Tracking.,2018-Nov-16,"Ahmad Delforouzi, Bhargav Pamarthi, Marcin Grzegorzek","Object tracking in challenging videos is a hot topic in machine vision. Recently, novel training-based detectors, especially using the powerful deep learning schemes, have been proposed to detect objects in still images. However, there is still a semantic gap between the object detectors and higher level applications like object tracking in videos. This paper presents a comparative study of outstanding learning-based object detectors such as ACF, Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN), FastRCNN, FasterRCNN and You Only Look Once (YOLO) for object tracking. We use an online and offline training method for tracking. The online tracker trains the detectors with a generated synthetic set of images from the object of interest in the first frame. Then, the detectors detect the objects of interest in the next frames. The detector is updated online by using the detected objects from the last frames of the video. The offline tracker uses the detector for object detection in still images and then a tracker based on Kalman filter associates the objects among video frames. Our research is performed on a TLD dataset which contains challenging situations for tracking. Source codes and implementation details for the trackers are published to make both the reproduction of the results reported in this paper and the re-use and further development of the trackers for other researchers. The results demonstrate that ACF and YOLO trackers show more stability than the other trackers."
Collaborative and privacy-preserving retired battery sorting for profitable direct recycling via federated machine learning.,2023-Dec-05,"Shengyu Tao, Haizhou Liu, Chongbo Sun, Haocheng Ji, Guanjun Ji, Zhiyuan Han, Runhua Gao, Jun Ma, Ruifei Ma, Yuou Chen, Shiyi Fu, Yu Wang, Yaojie Sun, Yu Rong, Xuan Zhang, Guangmin Zhou, Hongbin Sun","Unsorted retired batteries with varied cathode materials hinder the adoption of direct recycling due to their cathode-specific nature. The surge in retired batteries necessitates precise sorting for effective direct recycling, but challenges arise from varying operational histories, diverse manufacturers, and data privacy concerns of recycling collaborators (data owners). Here we show, from a unique dataset of 130 lithium-ion batteries spanning 5 cathode materials and 7 manufacturers, a federated machine learning approach can classify these retired batteries without relying on past operational data, safeguarding the data privacy of recycling collaborators. By utilizing the features extracted from the end-of-life charge-discharge cycle, our model exhibits 1% and 3% cathode sorting errors under homogeneous and heterogeneous battery recycling settings respectively, attributed to our innovative Wasserstein-distance voting strategy. Economically, the proposed method underscores the value of precise battery sorting for a prosperous and sustainable recycling industry. This study heralds a new paradigm of using privacy-sensitive data from diverse sources, facilitating collaborative and privacy-respecting decision-making for distributed systems."
Predicting and analyzing protein phosphorylation sites in plants using musite.,2012,"Qiuming Yao, Jianjiong Gao, Curtis Bollinger, Jay J Thelen, Dong Xu","Although protein phosphorylation sites can be reliably identified with high-resolution mass spectrometry, the experimental approach is time-consuming and resource-dependent. Furthermore, it is unlikely that an experimental approach could catalog an entire phosphoproteome. Computational prediction of phosphorylation sites provides an efficient and flexible way to reveal potential phosphorylation sites and provide hypotheses in experimental design. Musite is a tool that we previously developed to predict phosphorylation sites based solely on protein sequence. However, it was not comprehensively applied to plants. In this study, the phosphorylation data from Arabidopsis thaliana, B. napus, G. max, M. truncatula, O. sativa, and Z. mays were collected for cross-species testing and the overall plant-specific prediction as well. The results show that the model for A. thaliana can be extended to other organisms, and the overall plant model from Musite outperforms the current plant-specific prediction tools, Plantphos, and PhosphAt, in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a comparative study of predicted phosphorylation sites across orthologs among different plants was conducted to reveal potential evolutionary features. A bipolar distribution of isolated, non-conserved phosphorylation sites, and highly conserved ones in terms of the amino acid type was observed. It also shows that predicted phosphorylation sites conserved within orthologs do not necessarily share more sequence similarity in the flanking regions than the background, but they often inherit protein disorder, a property that does not necessitate high sequence conservation. Our analysis also suggests that the phosphorylation frequencies among serine, threonine, and tyrosine correlate with their relative proportion in disordered regions. Musite can be used as a web server (http://musite.net) or downloaded as an open-source standalone tool (http://musite.sourceforge.net/)."
Multilevel Weighted Support Vector Machine for Classification on Healthcare Data with Missing Values.,2016,"Talayeh Razzaghi, Oleg Roderick, Ilya Safro, Nicholas Marko","This work is motivated by the needs of predictive analytics on healthcare data as represented by Electronic Medical Records. Such data is invariably problematic: noisy, with missing entries, with imbalance in classes of interests, leading to serious bias in predictive modeling. Since standard data mining methods often produce poor performance measures, we argue for development of specialized techniques of data-preprocessing and classification. In this paper, we propose a new method to simultaneously classify large datasets and reduce the effects of missing values. It is based on a multilevel framework of the cost-sensitive SVM and the expected maximization imputation method for missing values, which relies on iterated regression analyses. We compare classification results of multilevel SVM-based algorithms on public benchmark datasets with imbalanced classes and missing values as well as real data in health applications, and show that our multilevel SVM-based method produces fast, and more accurate and robust classification results."
Deep coupled registration and segmentation of multimodal whole-brain images.,2024-Nov-01,"Tingting Han, Jun Wu, Pengpeng Sheng, Yuanyuan Li, ZaiYang Tao, Lei Qu","Recent brain mapping efforts are producing large-scale whole-brain images using different imaging modalities. Accurate alignment and delineation of anatomical structures in these images are essential for numerous studies. These requirements are typically modeled as two distinct tasks: registration and segmentation. However, prevailing methods, fail to fully explore and utilize the inherent correlation and complementarity between the two tasks. Furthermore, variations in brain anatomy, brightness, and texture pose another formidable challenge in designing multi-modal similarity metrics. A high-throughput approach capable of overcoming the bottleneck of multi-modal similarity metric design, while effective leveraging the highly correlated and complementary nature of two tasks is highly desirable."
Cybernic robot hand-arm that realizes cooperative work as a new hand-arm for people with a single upper-limb dysfunction.,2024,"Hiroaki Toyama, Hiroaki Kawamoto, Yoshiyuki Sankai","A robot hand-arm that can perform various tasks with the unaffected arm could ease the daily lives of patients with a single upper-limb dysfunction. A smooth interaction between robot and patient is desirable since their other arm functions normally. If the robot can move in response to the user's intentions and cooperate with the unaffected arm, even without detailed operation, it can effectively assist with daily tasks. This study aims to propose and develop a cybernic robot hand-arm with the following features: 1) input of user intention via bioelectrical signals from the paralyzed arm, the unaffected arm's motion, and voice; 2) autonomous control of support movements; 3) a control system that integrates voluntary and autonomous control by combining 1) and 2) to thus allow smooth work support in cooperation with the unaffected arm, reflecting intention as a part of the body; and 4) a learning function to provide work support across various tasks in daily use. We confirmed the feasibility and usefulness of the proposed system through a pilot study involving three patients. The system learned to support new tasks by working with the user through an operating function that does not require the involvement of the unaffected arm. The system divides the support actions into movement phases and learns the phase-shift conditions from the sensor information about the user's intention. After learning, the system autonomously performs learned support actions through voluntary phase shifts based on input about the user's intention via bioelectrical signals, the unaffected arm's motion, and by voice, enabling smooth collaborative movement with the unaffected arm. Experiments with patients demonstrated that the system could learn and provide smooth work support in cooperation with the unaffected arm to successfully complete tasks they find difficult. Additionally, the questionnaire subjectively confirmed that cooperative work according to the user's intention was achieved and that work time was within a feasible range for daily life. Furthermore, it was observed that participants who used bioelectrical signals from their paralyzed arm perceived the system as part of their body. We thus confirmed the feasibility and usefulness of various cooperative task supports using the proposed method."
Toxic Colors: The Use of Deep Learning for Predicting Toxicity of Compounds Merely from Their Graphic Images.,2018-Aug-27,"Michael Fernandez, Fuqiang Ban, Godwin Woo, Michael Hsing, Takeshi Yamazaki, Eric LeBlanc, Paul S Rennie, William J Welch, Artem Cherkasov","The majority of computational methods for predicting toxicity of chemicals are typically based on ""nonmechanistic"" cheminformatics solutions, relying on an arsenal of QSAR descriptors, often vaguely associated with chemical structures, and typically employing ""black-box"" mathematical algorithms. Nonetheless, such machine learning models, while having lower generalization capacity and interpretability, typically achieve a very high accuracy in predicting various toxicity endpoints, as unambiguously reflected by the results of the recent Tox21 competition. In the current study, we capitalize on the power of modern AI to predict Tox21 benchmark data using merely simple 2D drawings of chemicals, without employing any chemical descriptors. In particular, we have processed rather trivial 2D sketches of molecules with a supervised 2D convolutional neural network (2DConvNet) and demonstrated that the modern image recognition technology results in prediction accuracies comparable to the state-of-the-art cheminformatics tools. Furthermore, the performance of the image-based 2DConvNet model was comparatively evaluated on an external set of compounds from the Prestwick chemical library and resulted in experimental identification of significant and previously unreported antiandrogen potentials for several well-established generic drugs."

A Novel Method for Objective Selection of Information Sources Using Multi-Kernel SVM and Local Scaling.,2020-Jul-14,"Henry Jhoán Areiza-Laverde, Andrés Eduardo Castro-Ospina, María Liliana Hernández, Gloria M Díaz","Advancement on computer and sensing technologies has generated exponential growth in the data available for the development of systems that support decision-making in fields such as health, entertainment, manufacturing, among others. This fact has made that the fusion of data from multiple and heterogeneous sources became one of the most promising research fields in machine learning. However, in real-world applications, to reduce the number of sources while maintaining optimal system performance is an important task due to the availability of data and implementation costs related to processing, implementation, and development times. In this work, a novel method for the objective selection of relevant information sources in a multimodality system is proposed. This approach takes advantage of the ability of multiple kernel learning (MKL) and the support vector machines (SVM) classifier to perform an optimal fusion of data by assigning weights according to their discriminative value in the classification task; when a kernel is designed for representing each data source, these weights can be used as a measure of their relevance. Moreover, three algorithms for tuning the Gaussian kernel bandwidth in the classifier prediction stage are introduced to reduce the computational cost of searching for an optimal solution; these algorithms are an adaptation of a common technique in unsupervised learning named local scaling. Two real application tasks were used to evaluate the proposed method: the selection of electrodes for a classification task in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems and the selection of relevant Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences for detection of breast cancer. The obtained results show that the proposed method allows the selection of a small number of information sources."
Predicting human protein subcellular localization by heterogeneous and comprehensive approaches.,2017,"Chi-Hua Tung, Chi-Wei Chen, Han-Hao Sun, Yen-Wei Chu","Drug development and investigation of protein function both require an understanding of protein subcellular localization. We developed a system, REALoc, that can predict the subcellular localization of singleplex and multiplex proteins in humans. This system, based on comprehensive strategy, consists of two heterogeneous systematic frameworks that integrate one-to-one and many-to-many machine learning methods and use sequence-based features, including amino acid composition, surface accessibility, weighted sign aa index, and sequence similarity profile, as well as gene ontology function-based features. REALoc can be used to predict localization to six subcellular compartments (cell membrane, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi, mitochondrion, nucleus, and extracellular). REALoc yielded a 75.3% absolute true success rate during five-fold cross-validation and a 57.1% absolute true success rate in an independent database test, which was >10% higher than six other prediction systems. Lastly, we analyzed the effects of Vote and GANN models on singleplex and multiplex localization prediction efficacy. REALoc is freely available at http://predictor.nchu.edu.tw/REALoc."
Glossokinetic potential based tongue-machine interface for 1-D extraction.,2018-Jun,"Kutlucan Gorur, M Recep Bozkurt, M Serdar Bascil, Feyzullah Temurtas","The tongue is an aesthetically useful organ located in the oral cavity. It can move in complex ways with very little fatigue. Many studies on assistive technologies operated by tongue are called tongue-human computer interface or tongue-machine interface (TMI) for paralyzed individuals. However, many of them are obtrusive systems consisting of hardware such as sensors and magnetic tracer placed in the mouth and on the tongue. Hence these approaches could be annoying, aesthetically unappealing and unhygienic. In this study, we aimed to develop a natural and reliable tongue-machine interface using solely glossokinetic potentials via investigation of the success of machine learning algorithms for 1-D tongue-based control or communication on assistive technologies. Glossokinetic potential responses are generated by touching the buccal walls with the tip of the tongue. In this study, eight male and two female naive healthy subjects, aged 22-34 years, participated. Linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, and the k-nearest neighbor were used as machine learning algorithms. Then the greatest success rate was achieved an accuracy of 99% for the best participant in support vector machine. This study may serve disabled people to control assistive devices in natural, unobtrusive, speedy and reliable manner. Moreover, it is expected that GKP-based TMI could be alternative control and communication channel for traditional electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces which have significant inadequacies arisen from the EEG signals."

These frauds can go unnoticed within the supply chain due to the use of unspecific standard analytical methods for quality control. This research aims to develop a near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) method for the rapid and non-destructive quantitative evaluation of GSE powder in the presence of multiple additives. Samples were prepared by mixing GSE with pine bark extract (PBE) and green tea extract (GTE) on different levels between 0.5 and 13% in singular and dual combinations. Measurements were performed with a desktop and three different handheld devices for performance comparison. Following spectral pretreatment, partial least squares regression (PLSR) and support vector regression (SVR)-based quantitative models were built to predict extract concentrations and various chemical parameters. Cross- and external-validated models could reach a minimum "
